# MODULE 18 <br>RESTORE WEB APPS IN AZURE

## LAB 03- RESTORE WEB APPS IN AZURE

__Estimated time to complete this lab: 30 minutes__

This lab shows you how to restore an app in Azure App Service that you have previously backed up (see [Back up your app in Azure](https://github.com/makersinstitute/.net-academy/blob/master/azure/L01.md)). You can restore your app with its linked databases (SQL Database or MySQL) on-demand to a previous state, or create a new app based on one of your original app's backup. Creating a new app that runs in parallel to the latest version can be useful for A/B testing.

### Lab Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Restore an app from an existing backup
- Download or delete a backup from a storage account

### Lab Procedures

__A.	Restore an app from an existing backup__

Follow these steps to restore your app:

1. On the __Settings__ blade of your app in the Azure Portal, click __Backups__ to display the __Backups__ blade. Then click __Restore Now__ in the command bar.

    The __App backup__ option shows you all the existing backups of the current app, and you can easily select one. The __Storage__ option lets you select any backup ZIP file from any existing Azure Storage account and container in your subscription. If you're trying to restore a backup of another app, use the __Storage__ option.

3. Then, specify the destination for the app restore in __Restore destination__.

    > __Warning__<br>
    > If you choose __Overwrite__, all existing data in your current app will be erased. Before you click __OK__, make sure that it is exactly what you want to do.
    
    You can select Existing App to restore the app backup to another app in the same resoure group. Before you use this option, you should have already created another app in your resource group with mirroring database configuration to the one defined in the app backup.

4. Click __OK__.

__B.	Download or delete a backup from a storage account__

1. From the main __Browse__ blade of the Azure Portal, select __Storage accounts__.

    A list of your existing storage accounts will be displayed.

2. Select the storage account that contains the backup that you want to download or delete.

   The blade for the storage account will be displayed.
    
3. In the storage account blade, select the container you want

    The __Activity log__ blade displays all of your operations, along with level, status, resource, and time details.

2. Scroll down to find the desired restore operation and click to select it.

The details blade will display the available information related to the restore operation.
