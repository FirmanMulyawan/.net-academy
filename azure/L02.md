# MODULE 17 <br>BACKUP WEB APPS IN AZURE

## LAB 02- BACKUP WEB APPS IN AZURE

__Estimated time to complete this lab: 30 minutes__

This lab explains how to fully backup your web app in [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Make sure your web app has a __connection string__ to the database, so you can backup any databases that connected to your app.

### Lab Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Backup app configuration
- Backup file content
- Backup any databases connected to your app

### Lab Requirements and Restrictions
- The Backup and Restore feature requires the App Service plan to be in the __Standard__ tier or higher. For more information about scaling your App Service plan to use a higher tier, see [Scale up an app in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-web/web-sites-scale).
- You need an Azure storage account and container in the same subscription as the app that you want to back up. 
- Backups can be up to 10GB of app and database content. You will get an error if the backup size exceeds this limit.
