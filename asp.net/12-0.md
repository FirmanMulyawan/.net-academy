## Module Overview

Security is always the top priority for web applications, because publicly accessible web applications are usually the targets of different types of web attacks. Hackers use web attacks to access sensitive information. To help prevent these attacks, you need to know how to use AntiXSS and request validation for your web application. Using various security mechanisms, you can build a secure web application.

Another problem that developers usually face is the need to retain information amongst multiple postbacks. You need to know how to use state management techniques to retain information for multiple HTTP requests. Using state management, you can help reduce the need for users to re-enter information every time they need to place a request.

### Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Develop secure sites.

- Implement state management.
