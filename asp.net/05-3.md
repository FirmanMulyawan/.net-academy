## Lesson 3 <br> **Re-using Code in Views**

In a web application, you frequently render similar blocks of HTML content in different webpages. For example, in an e-commerce web application, you might want to display the most popular products on the home page, on the front page of the product catalog, at the top of the product search page, and perhaps in other locations. To render such HTML content in an MVC application, you may copy and paste code from one Razor view into others. However, to change the display of top products later in the project, you would then have to make identical changes in many locations. A better practice is to use a partial view. A partial view renders a section of HTML content that can be inserted into several other views at run time. Because the partial view is a single file that is re-used in several locations, when you implement a change in a single location, the changes are updated in other locations in the web application. Partial views increase the manageability of MVC web applications and facilitate a consistent presentation of content throughout a web application.

### Lesson Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- Describe how partial views enable you to re-use Razor code.

- Create partial views in an MVC 5 web application.

- Use partial views in an MVC 5 web application.

- Determine when to use partial views.

### Creating Partial Views

You can use partial views to render identical HTML or similar HTML in different locations in your web application. Consider a web application in which users can comment on articles. In the article view, you want to display the comments for that specific article at the end of the page. You want a similar display on the home page, but you want to display the most popular comments on any article. You can build a single comments partial view for this scenario as follows:

- First, create a partial view that displays a collection of comments in the required format.

- Next, create a controller action that retrieves the most popular comments, and then passes them to the partial view.

- Then, create another controller action that uses the article ID to find comments specific to that article. The controller action then passes this collection of comments to the partial view.

- Finally, call the appropriate actions from the home page and the article view.

Because the partial view renders a collection of comments, you can re-use it for various situations by passing different collections to it from controller actions.

#### **Creating and Naming Partial Views**

In Visual Studio, you can create a partial view by using the **Add View** dialog, in the same manner as creating any other view. Ensure that you select the **Create as a Partial View** check box. Because partial views render a small section of HTML rather than a complete webpage, Visual Studio does not add **\<head\>**, **\<body\>**, and other tags to the partial view. By convention, partial views are named prefixed with an underscore character, for example, **\_CommentsList.cshtml**. This convention is optional but is often helpful to distinguish partial views in Solution Explorer.

Partial views are often created inside the **/Views/Shared** folder in your site. Views in the **Shared** folder are accessible to many controllers, whereas views in the **/Views/Comment** folder are accessible only from the **CommentController**.

#### **Strongly-typed and dynamic partial views**

Similar to other views, you can create strongly-typed partial views if you are certain that the partial view will always display the same model class. Visual Studio can provide the most informative IntelliSense feedback and error-checking for strongly-typed partial views, when compared with other types of views. A strongly-typed view has the declaration of the **@model** directive at the top of the file. Alternatively, you can create a dynamic partial view if you are not certain that the partial view will always display the same model class. You can create dynamic partial views by omitting the **@model** directive declaration.

In the following example of a partial view, you can see the **@model** declaration that makes the partial view strongly-typed. You can also see that the partial view renders only an unordered list and not a complete HTML webpage as the following lines of code indicate.

**A Strongly-Typed Partial View**

``` Razor
@model IEnumerable<Adworks.Models.Comment> 
<ul>    
  @foreach (var item in Model) {       
    <li>          
      Subject: @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => item.Subject)       
    </li>    
  } 
</ul>
```

**Question:** You want to create a partial view that displays a list of comments. The comments partial view will be called by actions in the **PhotoController** and the **HomeController**. In which folder should you create the partial view file?

### Using Partial Views

![](_/5-13.jpg)

Besides knowing how to create partial views, you need to know how to use them within multiple other views in your site. You can re-use partial views by using the **Html.Partial()** and **Html.Action()** HTML helpers.

#### **The Html.Partial() Helper**

You can use the **Html.Partial()** helper to render a partial view within another view file. MVC inserts the HTML that the partial view renders into the parent view and returns the complete webpage to the browser. The first parameter is the name of the partial view file without its file extension. The second optional parameter is a model object for the partial view to render. This is the same model object that the parent view uses because other model objects are not available in this context.

The following lines of code call the **\_Comments.cshtml** partial view without passing a model object.

**Using the Html.Partial() Helper**

``` Razor
@Html.Partial("_Comments")
```

Remember that you can use the **ViewBag** and **ViewData** collections to pass data between the action method and the view. A parent view will share the same **ViewBag** or **ViewData** objects with the partial view. This is a good way to share data between the controller action, view, and partial view.

#### **The Html.Action() Helper**

You can pass a model object from the parent view to a partial view when you use **Html.Partial()**. However, the parent view can only pass the same model object available in the parent view. Sometimes, you may want to use a model object different from the parent view, often of a different model class, with the partial view. In such cases, you can use the **Html.Action()** helper. This calls an action method that returns the correct partial view. The action method can create an instance of any model class.

Consider an **Article** view that displays the text and title of an **Article** object. You want to display comments at the end of this view in a partial view. You can use the **Html.Action()**helper to call an action in the **Comments** controller that returns such a partial view. The partial view can work with a collection of **Comment** objects.

In the following example, the **Html.Action()** helper calls an action in the **CommentController** controller and passes the ID of the current article model object.

**Using the Html.Action() Helper**

``` Razor
@Html.Action("_CommentsForArticle", "Comment", new { ArticleID = Model.ID })
```

**Question:** You want to display user reviews of a product to each product page. You have created a **\_ReviewsForProduct** partial view. Would you use **Html.Partial()** or **Html.Action()** to render this view?

### Discussion: Partial ViewScenarios

![](_/5-14.jpg)

Consider the following scenarios when creating a web application:

- You want to display the ten latest comments in the web application. When users click the **Latest Comments** link on the home page, they will see a new webpage with the comments displayed.

- You want to display the comments for an article on the **Article** view. You also want to display the comments for a product on the **Product** view. There are separate **ArticleComment** and **ProductComment** classes in your model, but they have similar properties.

- You have a photo sharing web application and you want to display a gallery of thumbnail images on both the **AllPhotos** view and the home page **Index** view. The **AllPhotos** view should show every **Photo** object, but the home page **Index** view should display only the three most recent photos uploaded.

For each scenario, discuss with the class:

- Whether you need to create a view or a partial view.

- Whether you need to create a strongly-typed view or a dynamic view.

- If you decide to create a partial view, whether you need to use the **Html.Partial()** or the **Html.Action()** HTML helper in the parent view.
