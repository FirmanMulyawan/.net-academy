## Lesson 1 <br> **Creating Views with Razor Syntax**

When a user makes a request to an MVC web application, a controller responds. Often, the controller action instantiates a model object, for example, a **Product**. The controller might get the **Product** by querying the database, by creating a new **Product**, or by performing some other step. To display the **Product**, the controller creates a view and passes the **Product** to it. The view builds a webpage by inserting properties from the **Product**, and sometimes, from other sources, into HTML markup. MVC sends the completed webpage to the browser. To create views, you must understand how MVC interprets the code you place in views and how a completed HTML page is built. By default, the Razor view engine performs this interpretation, but you can also use other view engines. If you take time to understand Razor, you will find it to be an excellent and versatile view engine that gives a great degree of control over the rendered HTML. Other view engines have very different syntaxes, which you may prefer if you have worked with earlier versions of ASP.NET or other server-side web technologies, such as Ruby on Rails.

#### Lesson Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- Add views to an MVC 5 web application.

- Use the @ symbol in a Razor view to treat code as content.

- Describe the features of Razor syntax.

- Bind views to model classes to display data.

- Explain how to render HTML that is accessible to visitors with low vision.

- List a few alternative view engines to the Razor view engine.

### Adding Views

![](_/5-1.jpg)

In an MVC application, there is usually one controller for every model class. For example, a model class named **Product** usually has a controller called **ProductController** that contains all the actions relevant to products. There may be some controllers that do not correspond to any model classes, such as the **HomeController**.

However, each controller can have multiple views. For example, you may want to create the following views for **Product** objects:

- _Details_. The details view can display a **Product**, its price, catalog number, and other details.

- _Create_. The create view can enable users to add a new **Product** in the catalog.

- _Edit_. The edit view can enable users to modify the properties of an existing **Product**.

- _Delete_. The delete view can enable users to remove a **Product** from the catalog.

- _Index_. The index view can display all the **Product** objects in the catalog.

By convention, an MVC web application creates all views within the top-level **Views** folder. Within this folder, there is a folder for each controller in the application. In the preceding example, the **Views** folder would contain a **Product** folder. This folder would contain the Details, Create, Edit, Delete, and Index views.

If you use the Razor view engine and the C# language, views are files with a .cshtml extension. If you use the Razor view engine and the Visual Basic language, views are files with a .vbhtml extension. Other view engines use different extensions.

#### **How to Create a View File**

You can add a view file in Visual Studio by performing the following steps:

1.In the **Solution Explorer** pane, select the folder where you want to create the view. For example, for a controller named **ProductController**, MVC expects view files to be located in the **Views/Product** folder.

2.Right-click the selected folder, point to **Add**, and then select **View**.

Alternatively, you can create a view file for a particular controller action by opening the controller code file, right-clicking the action, and then clicking **Add View**. If you create a view by using the controller code file, some properties in the **Add View** dialog box are filled in by default.

The following table describes the properties that you must complete in the **Add View** dialog box.

|Property |Description|
|---|---|
|View name |This is the name of the view. The view file name is this name with the appropriate extension added. The name you choose should match the name returned by the corresponding controller action. If the action controller does not specify the name of the view to use, MVC assumes the name of the view matches the name of the controller action.|
|View engine |By default, you can select the Razor or ASPX view engines in this list. Other engines may be available if you have installed them. |
|Create a strongly-typed view |When you select this check box, you bind the view to a specific model class, such as a Product class. When you use strongly-typed views, you get additional IntelliSense and error checking help in Visual Studio as you write code in the view.|
|Model class |If you create a strongly-typed view, you need to specify the model class to bind to the view. Visual Studio will use this class when it formulates IntelliSense prompts and checks for compile-time errors. |
|Scaffold template |A scaffold template is a basic view that Visual Studio can use to create the view. If you specify a model class for the view, Visual Studio can create simple templates for Create, Edit, Details, Delete, and List views. When you become more experienced in using views, you may prefer to build a view from the empty scaffold template, rather than use populated scaffold templates.|
|Reference script libraries |When you select this check box, links to common client-side script files are included in the view. These links include the jQuery JavaScript library. |
|Create as a partial view |A partial view is a section of Razor code that you can re-use in multiple views in your application. |
|Use a layout or master page |A layout or master page can be used to impose a standard layout and branding on many pages within the web application. |

**Note:** You will see other view engines later in this module.

**Question:** You are using the Razor view engine and Visual Basic to create views. You right-click the **Delete** action in the **CustomerController.vb** file. What is the name of the view file that Visual Studio will create by default?

### Differentiating Server Side Code from HTML

![](_/5-2.jpg)

The Razor view engine interprets view files and runs any server-side code contained in the view files. To do this, Razor must distinguish server-side code from HTML content that should be sent to the browser unchanged.

The Razor view engine looks for the @ symbol to identify server-side code.

In the following code example, Razor runs the line with the @ symbol as C# code on the web server. This code example displays the value of the **Title** property of the model class.

**Using @ to Declare Server-Side Code**

``` Razor
<p>
  Razor will not interpret any character in this line as code, because there is no “at” symbol
</p> 
<p>    
  The photo title is:     
  @Model.Title 
</p>
```

A section of code marked with the @ symbol is referred to as a Razor code expression. In Razor syntax, you mark the start of a Razor code expression with the @ symbol, but unlike the ASPX view engine, Razor lacks an expression ending symbol. Instead, Razor infers the end of a code expression by using a fairly sophisticated parsing engine.

#### **Modifying the Interpretation of Code and Content**

Sometimes, you may need to modify the logic that Razor uses to interpret code expressions. For example, if you want to display an @ symbol in the browser, you use @@. Razor interprets this as an escape sequence and renders a single @ symbol. This technique is useful for rendering email addresses.

Razor has sophisticated logic to distinguish code from content and often the @ symbol is all that is required. However, occasionally, you may find that an error occurs because Razor misinterprets content as code. To fix such errors, you can use the @: delimiter, which explicitly declares a line as content and not code.

If you want to declare several lines as content, use the <text> tag instead of the @: delimiter. Razor removes the <text> and </text> tags before returning the content to the browser.

In the following code example, Razor interprets the @: delimiter to display plain text.

**Using the @: Delimiter**

``` Razor
@( 
  @: This text is in a code block but the delimiter declares it as content. 
)
```

#### **HTML Encoding**

For security reasons, when Razor runs any server-side code that returns a string, it encodes the string as HTML before rendering it to the browser. For example, you may have a **Comment** model class with the following properties:

- _Subject_. This property contains a subject for the comment as a simple string with no formatting information.

- _HtmlComment_. This property contains the comment text itself. More important, it includes the formatting information as HTML tags. For example, it might include `<i>` tags to italicize a word.

If you have used the normal **@Model.HtmlComment** syntax to return the formatted comment text, Razor encodes `<` as `&lt` and `>` as `&gt` in the HTML source. This results in the user seeing `<i>` on the webpage. This is not the behavior you intend because you want the users to see italicized text.

To render text without HTML encoding, use the **Html.Raw()** helper. For example, use **@Html.Raw(Model.HtmlComment)**.

**Note:** Razor encodes text as HTML for a specific security reasonto stop malicious users from injecting malicious code into your web application. If such attacks are successful, injected code may circumvent security restrictions in your web application and deny service to users, or it may access sensitive information. Therefore, you should only use the **Html.Raw()** helper when it is absolutely necessary. Also, if you must use the **Html.Raw()** helper, you must ensure that it does not operate on unchecked strings entered by users.

### Features of Razor Syntax

![](_/5-3.png)

Razor includes many useful features that you can use to control the manner in which ASP.NET MVC renders your view as HTML. These features include the following:

#### **Razor Comments**

You may want to include comments in your Razor code to describe it to other developers in your team. This is an important technique that improves developer productivity by making it easier to understand code.

You can declare a Razor comment by using the **@*** delimiter, as shown in the following code example.

**A Razor Comment**

``` Razor
@* This text will not be rendered by the Razor view engine, because this is a comment. *@ 
```

#### **Implicit Code Expressions and Parentheses**

Razor uses implicit code expressions to determine parts of a line that are server-side code. Usually, implicit code expressions render the HTML you want, but occasionally, you might find that Razor interprets an expression as HTML when it should be run as server-side code.

For example, if the **Product.Price** property contains the value 2.00, the following code renders "Price Including Sales Tax: 2.00 * 1.2".

**An Implicit Code Expression**

``` Razor
<span>Price Including Sales Tax: @Model.Price * 1.2</span>
```

You can control and alter this behavior by using parentheses to enclose the expression for Razor to evaluate.

For example, if the **Product.Price** property contains the value 2.00, the following code renders "Price Including Sales Tax: 2.40".

**Using Parentheses to Explicitly Delimit Expressions**

``` Razor
<span>Price Including Sales Tax: @(Model.Price * 1.2)</span> 
```

#### **Razor Code Blocks, Loops, and Conditions**

If you want to write multiple lines of server-side code, you can do it without prefacing every line with the @ symbol by using a Razor code block.

**A Razor Code Block**

``` Razor
@ {    
  //Razor interprets all text within these curly braces as server-side code. 
}
```

Razor also includes code blocks that run conditional statements or loop through collections.

For example, Razor runs the following code only if the **Product.InStock** Boolean property returns **true**. 

**A Razor If Code Block**

``` Razor
@if (Model.InStock) {    
  Html.ActionLink("Buy This Product", "AddToCart")
} 
```

Razor loops are useful for creating index views, which display many objects of a particular model class. A product catalog page, which displays many products from the database, is a good example of an index view. To implement an index view, a controller action passes an enumerable collection of objects to the view.

You can loop through all the objects in an enumerable collection by using the **foreach** code block:

**A Razor Foreach Code Block**

``` Razor
@foreach (var item in Model) 
{    
  <div>@item.ProductName</div> 
}
```

**Question:** You want to describe a code block to developers in your view file. You do not want your description to be passed to the browser. What syntax should you use?

### Binding Views to Model Classes and Displaying Properties

![](_/5-4.jpg)

Many Razor views are designed to display properties from a specific model class. If you bind such views to the class they display, you get extra help such as IntelliSense feedback as you write the Razor code. Other views may display properties from different model classes in different cases, or may not use a model class at all. These views cannot be bound to a model class and are called dynamic views. You must understand how to write Razor code for both these situations.

**Strongly-Typed Views**

In many cases, when you create a view, you know that the controller action will always pass an object of a specific model class. For example, if you are writing the **Display** view for the **Display** action in the **Product** controller, you know from the action code that the action will always pass a **Product** object to the view.

In such cases, you can create a strongly-typed view. A strongly-typed view is a view that includes a declaration of the model class. When you declare the model class in the view, Visual Studio helps you with additional IntelliSense feedback and error-checking as you write the code. This is possible because Visual Studio can check the properties that the model class includes. Troubleshooting run-time errors is also easy. You should create strongly-typed views whenever you can so that you benefit from this extra IntelliSense and error-checking. If you follow this as a best practice, you will make fewer coding errors. A strongly-typed view only works with an object of the model class in the declaration.

To create a strongly-typed view in Visual Studio, select **Create a strongly typed view** in the **Add View** dialog box, and then choose the model class to bind to the view.

You can choose the **Product** model class so that Visual Studio can bind the view to the class you specify, by adding the following line of code at the top of the view file.

**The Model Declaration**

``` Razor
@model MyWebSite.Models.Product
```

Later in the view file, you can access properties of the model object by using the **Model** helper. For example, you might access a product catalog number in this manner: **@Model.CatalogNumber**.

#### **Binding to an Enumerable List**

Some views display many instances of a model class. For example, a product catalog page displays many instances of the **Product** model class. In such cases, the controller action passes a list of model objects to the view, instead of a single model object. You can still create a strongly-typed view in this situation, but you must use a different model declaration. You usually loop through the items in the list by using a Razor **foreach** loop.

The following code example shows a multiple-item view with the model declaration and the loop that enumerates all the **Product** objects passed by the action.

**A View of a List of Objects**

``` Razor
@model IEnumerable<MyWebSite.Models.Product> 
<h1>Product Catalog</h1> 
@foreach (var Product in Model) 
{    
  <div>Name: @Product.Name</div>
}
```

#### **Using Dynamic Views**

Sometimes, you might want to create a view that can display more than one model class. For example, you might want to create a view that can display your own products and products from a different supplier, together. These model classes might be named **Product** and **ThirdPartyProduct**. Some properties can be similar while others differ. For example, both **Product** and **ThirdPartyProduct** might include the **Price** property while only the **ThirdPartyProduct** model class includes the **Supplier** property.

Furthermore, sometimes, the controller action does not pass any model class to the view. The most common example of such a classless view is the site home page.

In such cases, you can create a dynamic view. A dynamic view does not include the **@model** declaration at the top of the page. You can choose to add the **@model** declaration to change the view into a strongly-typed view, later.

When you create dynamic views, you receive less helpful IntelliSense feedback and error checking because Visual Studio cannot check the model class properties to verify the code. In such scenarios, you have to ensure that you access only the properties that exist. To access a property that may or may not exist, such as the **ThirdPartyProduct.Supplier** property in the preceding example, check the property for **null** before you use it.

**Question:** You want to write a view that displays ten objects of the **Photo**model class. What model declaration should you use?

### Rendering Accessible HTML

![](_/5-5.jpg)

The Internet is for everyone, regardless of any disabilities an individual user may have. Furthermore, if users with disabilities cannot easily browse your website, they may visit your competitors websites and your company may lose business. You should therefore ensure that people with disabilitiessuch as those who have low vision or are hard-of-hearingcan use your web application, and that their web browsers can parse the HTML content that your site presents. Because MVC views are responsible for rendering HTML in an MVC web application, you render accessible HTML by writing views that follow accessibility guidelines. When you write views, keep the following challenges and best practices in mind.

Users have different requirements depending on their abilities and disabilities. For example, consider the following factors:

- Users with low vision may use a standard browser, but they may increase text size with a screen magnifier so that they can read the content.

- Profoundly blind users may use a browser with text-to-speech software or text-to-Braille hardware.

- Color-blind users may have difficulty if a color difference is used to highlight text.

- Deaf users may not be able to access audio content.

- Users with limited dexterity may find it difficult to click small targets.

- User with epilepsy may have seizures if presented with flashing content.

You can ensure that your content is accessible to the broadest range of users by adhering to the following guidelines:

- Do not rely on color differences to highlight text or other content. For example, links should be underlined or formatted in bold font to emphasize them to color-blind users.

- Always provide equivalent alternative content for visual and auditory content. For example, always complete the **alt** attribute for images. Use this attribute to describe the image so that text-to-speech software or text-to-Braille hardware can render meaningful words to the user.

- Use markup and style sheets to separate content from structure and presentation code. This helps text interpretation software to render content to users without being confused by structural and presentation code. For example, you should apply the following best practices to display content on your webpage:

  - Avoid using tables to display the content. You should use tables only to present tabulated content. Tables can be used to render graphics and branding on a webpage, but in an accessible site, use positional style sheets to display content. Text readers do not read style sheets.

  - Avoid using nested tables. In a nested table, a table cell contains another table. These are particularly confusing to text readers because they read each table cell in a sequential order. The user is likely to become disoriented and unable to determine which cell is being read and what it means.

  - Avoid using images that include important text. Text readers cannot render text from within an image file. Instead, use markup to render this text.

**Additional Reading:** The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has a project called the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) that promotes accessible web content. This project has published the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). These guidelines are accepted by the web publishing industry as definitive. To read the full guidelines, go to: [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=288955&clcid=0x409](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=288955&amp;clcid=0x409)

**Note:** In ASP.NET MVC, the developer has complete control over the HTML that the web server sends to the web browser. However, you must understand accessibility principles to write accessible MVC views. Ensure that your entire development team is familiar with the requirements of accessibility and the related best practices.

**Question:** You want to present your company logo at the uppermost part of the page. The logo is a .gif file that includes the name of the company in an unusual font. How can you ensure that the logo is accessible?

### Alternative View Engines

![](_/5-6.png)

A view engine is a component of the MVC framework that is responsible for locating view files, running the server-side code they contain, and rendering HTML that the browser can display to the user. Many views work with the Razor view engine. Razor is the default view engine in MVC 5 and is a highly flexible and efficient view engine.

However, some developers may prefer to use a different view engine for the following reasons:

- _View Location Logic_. Razor assumes that all views are located in the **Views** top- level folder. Within this, Razor assumes that each controller has a separate folder. For example, views for the **ProductController**are located in the **Product**folder within **Views**. Razor also looks for some views in the **Shared** subfolder. These views can be used by more than one controller. If you do not like this view location logic, you can use an alternate view engine, or create a custom view engine.

- _View Syntax_. Each view engine uses a different syntax in view files. For example, in Razor, the **@** symbol delimits server-side code. By contrast, in the ASPX view engine, **\<% %\>** delimiters are used. This is familiar to developers who have worked with Web Forms. You may prefer one syntax over another for the following reasons:

  - _Experience_. The technologies that you or your team have previously worked with may make it easier for you to learn the syntax of a specific view engine.

  - _Readability_. Some view engines work with view files that are easily readable for anyone who knows HTML. Web designers, who do not know C# or other programming languages, may be able to learn readable syntaxes.

  - _Succinctness_. Some view engines work with view files that are terse and generate HTML with relatively small amounts of code.

#### **Common View Engines**

The following table describes and compares four popular view engines.

|View Engine |Description |Code Example |
|---|---|---|
|Razor |This is the default view engine for MVC 4. It is easy to learn for anyone who has experience in HTML and C# or Visual Basic. Visual Studio provides good IntelliSense feedback for Razor code and it is compatible with unit testing. |`@model IEnumerable<MyWebSite.Models.Product> <ul> @foreach (var p in Model) {    <li>Name: @p.Name</li> }`|
|ASPX |This was the default view engine for MVC 1 and 2. It is easy to learn for developers with experience in ASP.NET Web Forms and it is also known as the Web Forms View Engine. It includes good IntelliSense feedback. |`<%@ Control Inherits= "System.Web.Mvc.ViewPage<IEnumerable<Product>>" %> <ul> <% foreach(var p in model){%>     <li><%=p.Name%></li> <%}%> </ul>`|
|NHaml |NHaml is a .NET Framework version of the Haml view engine used with Ruby on Rails, a competitor to ASP.NET MVC. Developers who have developed websites with Ruby on Rails may prefer this view engine. Visual Studio does not provide IntelliSense feedback for this view engine. NHaml syntax is terse and efficient, but often less intelligible to inexperienced developers. |`@type=IEnumerable<Product> %ul   - foreach (var p in model)     %li= p.Name `|
|Spark |This view engine uses view files that are easily readable and similar to static HTML files. This design results in view files that are readable for anyone who knows HTML. You can obtain IntelliSense support for Spark in Visual Studio.|`<viewdata products="IEnumerable[[Product]]"/> <ul if="products.Any()">     <li each="var p in products">${p.Name}</li> </ul> `|

#### **Creating Custom View Engines**

You can also create your own view engine to implement custom logic for locating views or to implement custom syntax for view files. Custom view engines are rarely created because the existing view engines are powerful, flexible, and easy to learn. The default logic for finding view files is also simple and rarely needs modification. To create a custom view engine, you must take the following steps:

- _Create a View Class_. This class must implement the **IView**interface and have a **Render()** method. You need to write the custom logic in the **Render()** method for interpreting custom syntax. This code is likely to include regular expressions and other sophisticated string-parsing code.

- _Create a View Engine_. This class should inherit the **VirtualPathProviderViewEngine** class and include the **CreateView()** and **CreatePartialView()** methods. By inheriting from the **ViewPathProviderViewEngine** class, you can modify the **ViewLocationFormat** property to implement custom logic for locating views.

- _Register the Custom View Engine_. To register your custom view engine with MVC, call **ViewEngines.Engines.Add()** in the Global.asax file.

**Additional Reading:** For more information about creating custom view engines in ASP.NETMVCpage,see: [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=288958&clcid=0x409](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=288958&amp;clcid=0x409)

**Question:** Is there any HTML markup that the Razor view engine cannot render?
