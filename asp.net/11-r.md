# Module 11 Review and Takeaways <br> Controlling Access to ASP.NET MVC 5 Web Applications

In this module, you discussed the various membership and role providers in ASP.NET 4.5\. You compared the benefits of using **SimpleProviders** and **UniversalProviders** with the benefits of using other providers, for database-centric applications. However, for applications that need to use Windows for authentication and authorization, you can use the existing role and membership providers. You also viewed how to implement custom providers, to add functionalities such as password encryption to your web application.

## **Review Question(s)**

**Question:** What is the key difference between implementing authentication and authorization in ASP.NET 4.5 from implementing the same in the previous versions of ASP.NET?

## **Real-world Issues and Scenarios**

When you create web applications, you may need to create custom providers because you do not want to use the schema provided by Microsoft. However, you can use **SimpleProviders** to remove the need to develop custom providers and reduce the effort required for building applications.
