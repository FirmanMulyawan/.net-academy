## Module Overview

MVC controllers respond to browser requests, create model objects, and pass them to views for rendering and displaying in the web browser. If required, controllers can also perform other actions, such as saving model class changes to the database. Controllers are central to MVC applications. You need to understand the functioning of controllers to be able to create the right model objects, manipulate them, and pass them to the right views.

To maximize the re-use of code in controllers, you must know how to program action filters. You can use action filters to run code before or after every action in your web application, on every action in a controller, or on other combinations of controller actions.

### Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Add a controller to a web application that responds to user actions specified in the project design.

- Write code in action filters that runs before or after a controller action.
