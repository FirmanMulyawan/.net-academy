# Module 12 Review and Takeaways <br> Building a Resilient ASP.NET MVC 5 Web Application

Web applications are usually subject to different kinds of attacks. These attacks enable attackers to access sensitive information stored in the database and to perform malicious actions. You can use AntiXSS and request validation, to protect the applications from web attacks. You can also use state management techniques to store information for multiple HTTP requests to help avoid users from typing the same information more than once.

## **Review Question(s)**

**Question:**Recently, an error occurred in one of applications that you had developed for your company. After performing few tests, you realize that the issue was due to an HTML code that was passed from the user to the server. You want to prevent such issues in the future. What would you consider to do?

## **Real-world Issues and Scenarios**

Complex business functions usually involve multiple views. Such functions can pose problems because information must be shared across multiple views. Session state management helps resolve these problems, because it enables retaining information pertinent to multiple views.
