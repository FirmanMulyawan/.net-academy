# MODULE 15 <br>DEPLOYING  ASP.NET MVC 5  <br> WEB  APPLICATIONS

## LAB 15- DEPLOYING ASP.NET MVC 5 WEB APPLICATIONS

__Estimated time to complete this lab: 45 minutes__

This lab explains how to host your MVC 5 web application in IIS Express and store the data and information in the database created in SQL Server 2008. Visual Studio uses the ASP.NET Development Server as a default and here we're using IIS Server to host a MVC 5 web application. For this lab we use the Visual Studio 2013 to develop an application using the MVC project template.

### Lab Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Create MVC 5 Application
- Publish the  Application
- Configure HS Server

### Lab Procedures

__A.	Creating MVC 5 Application__

Fo11ow these steps to create MVC 5 application:

1. Open __Visual Studio Professional 2015.__

4.	In your Solution Explorer, open the Web.config file. As you can see, the corutection property is available on my file: 

    ```
    <add name="DefaultConnection" connectionString="Data Source=(LocalDb)\MSSQLLocalDB;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\aspnet-MvcIISDemo-20161210103157.mdf;Initial Catalog=aspnet-MvcIISDemo-20161210103157;Integrated Security=True" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
    ```

    Now, change the code above as shown below:

8.	Verify in SQL Server 2008. As you can see, we did not create a database nor any table in my SQL Server 2008. When we declared our connection string, it automatically created a database and table in SQL Server.

	So far, this lab will help you to learn to create an MVC 5 Application to store the data and information in SQL Server directly and you don't need to worry about creating the database manually. With this lab you can also learn to publish your article and browse your application from IIS Manager and the application will run on the IIS Server.
