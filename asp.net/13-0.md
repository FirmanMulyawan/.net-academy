## Module Overview

Most web applications require integration with external systems such as mobile applications. You need to know how to use Web APIs to promote application interaction with external systems. You can use the Web API to implement Representational State Transfer (REST) services in your application. REST services help reduce application overhead and limit the data that is transmitted between client and server systems. You need to know how to call Web API services by using server-side code, jQuery code, and JSON.NET library to effectively implement REST-style Web APIs in your application.
