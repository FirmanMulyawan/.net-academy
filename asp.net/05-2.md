## Lesson 2 <br> **Using HTML Helpers**

The ASP.NET MVC 5 Framework includes many HTML helper functions that you can use in views. HTML helpers are C# methods that you can call to render values, labels, and input controls such as text boxes. Helpers include common logic that makes it easier for you to render HTML for MVC model class properties and other tasks. Some HTML helpers examine the definition of a property in a model class and then render appropriate HTML. Some HTML helpers call controller actions and others validate user input data. You can also create custom HTML helpers. You need to know the appropriate HTML helper to use in any scenario and how to pass the correct parameters to relevant HTML helpers.

### Lesson Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to :

- Use the **Html.ActionLink** and **Url.Action** helpers to call a controller action.

- Use the **Html.DisplayNameFor** and **HtmlDisplayFor** helpers to display the value of a model class property.

- Use the **Html.LabelFor** and **HTML.EditorFor** helpers to render an editor control for a model class property.

- Use the **Html.BeginForm** helper to render a form for a controller action.

- Use HTML helpers to validate data typed by users.

- Use various HTML helpers to build a user interface for a web application.

### Using Action Helpers

![](_/5-7.jpg)

HTML helpers are simple methods that in most cases return a string. This string is a small section of HTML that the view engine can insert into the view file to generate the completed webpage. You can write views that render any type of HTML content without using a single helper if you prefer not to use HTML helpers. However, HTML helpers make the task of managing HTML content easier by rendering common HTML strings for often- used scenarios.

The **Html.ActionLink()** and **Url.Action()** helpers enable you to render HTML that calls controller actions.

#### **The Html.ActionLink() Helper**

When the user makes a request to an MVC web application, the ASP.NET MVC 5 framework forwards the request to the correct controller and action, thereby passing the correct parameters. It is possible for users to make such requests by typing a URL into the Address bar of a web browser, but they rarely know the name of the controller, action, or parameters. Instead, they usually click a link. The **Html.ActionLink()** helper can be used to render links to actions for you. The helper returns an **\<a\>** element with the correct **href** parameter value when users click a link in a webpage.

In the following code example, the **Html.Actionlink()** helper renders an **\<a\>** element that calls the **Display** action in the **Photo** controller, and passes an integer for the photo ID.

**Using the Html.ActionLink() Helper**

``` Razor
@Html.ActionLink("Click here to view photo 1", "Display", new { id = 1 })
```

By default, the example renders the following HTML:

``` html
<a href="/photo/display/1">Click here to view photo 1</a>
```

Notice that you pass parameters to the helper by using an anonymous object. In this manner, you can pass multiple parameters.

**Note:** The **Html.ActionLink()** helper works with the routing engine to formulate the correct URL for the link. The helper will render the **href** value above, assuming it is called from a PhotoController view. There are several overloads of the ActionLink helper, however, if you wish to use it to call actions in other controllers.

#### **The Url.Action Helper**

The **Url.Action()** helper renders a URL by using the routing engine without rendering the enclosing **\<a\>** element.

You can use the **Url.Action()** helper to populate the **src** attribute of an **\<img\>** element or **\<script\>** element. This helper is useful whenever you want to formulate a URL to a controller action without rendering a hyperlink.

The following code example shows how to render an image by calling the **Url.Action** helper within the **src** attribute of an **img** element:

**Rendering an Image from an Action**

``` Razor
<img alt="This image came from an action" src="@Url.Action("GetImage", new { id = 1 })" />
```

**Question:** You want to render an HTML5 **\<audio\>** tag to play a sound file from an action. Would you use the **Html.ActionLink()** helper or the **Url.Action()** helper?

### Using Display Helpers

![](_/5-8.jpg)

MVC includes several helpers that display properties from model classes. You can use these helpers to build views that display product details, comment details, user details, and so on. **Html.DisplayNameFor()** renders the name of a model class property. **Html.DisplayFor()** renders the value of a model class property. Both these helpers examine the definition of the property in the model class, including the data display annotations, to ensure that they render the most appropriate HTML.

#### **The Html.DisplayNameFor() Helper**

You use the **Html.DisplayNameFor()** helper to render the display name for a property from the model class. If your view is strongly-typed, Visual Studio checks whether the model class contains a property with the right name as you type the code. Otherwise, you must ensure that you use a property that exists or verify that it is not **null** before you use it. You specify the property of the model class to the **Html.DisplayNameFor()** HTML helper by using a lambda expression.

The following code example renders the display name of the **CreatedDate** property by using the

**Html.DisplayNameFor()** HTML helper .

**Using the Html.DisplayNameFor() Helper**

``` Razor
@Html.DisplayNameFor(model => model.CreatedDate) 
```

The text rendered by the **Html.DisplayNameFor()**helper depends on the model class. If you used a DisplayName annotation to give a more descriptive name to a property, then **Html.DisplayNameFor()** will use that DisplayName annotation value; otherwise, it will render the name of the property.

#### **TheHtml.DisplayFor() Helper**

The **Html.DisplayFor()** helper considers any display annotations that you specify in the model class, and then renders the value of the property.

In the following code example, the **Html.DisplayFor()** helper is used to render a date string.

**Using the Html.DisplayFor() Helper**

```
This was created on: @Html.DisplayFor(model => model.CreatedDate)
```

If you used the **DisplayFormat** annotation in the model class with DataFormatString set to "{0:dd/MM/yy}", then the **Html.DisplayFor()** helper ensures that the date is displayed in short date format.

**Question:** You want to ensure that a view displays This product was last changed onbefore the **ModifiedDate** property. This text is declared in the class with the **DisplayName** annotation. What code would you write in the view?

### The Begin Form Helper

![](_/5-9.jpg)

To accept user input, you must provide a form on your webpage. A typical form consists of a set of labels and input controls. The labels indicate to the user the property for which they must provide a value. The input controls enable the user to enter a value. Input controls can be text boxes, check boxes, radio buttons, file selectors, drop- down lists, or other types of control. There is usually a submit button and cancel button on forms.

#### **Rendering HTML Forms**

To build a form in HTML, you must start with a **\<form\>** element in the HTML webpage. All labels and input controls must be within the **\<form\>** element. In an MVC view, you can use the **Html.BeginForm()** helper to render this element and set the controller action to which the form sends data.

You can also specify the HTTP method that the form uses to submit data. If the form uses the POST method, which is the default, the browser sends form values to the web server in the body of the form. If the form uses the GET method, the browser sends form values to the web server in the query string in the URL.

In the rendered HTML, the **\<form\>** element must be closed with a **\</form\>** tag. In Razor views, you can ensure that the form element is closed with an **@using** code block. Razor renders the **\</form\>** tag at the closing bracket of the code block.

The following code example shows how to render a form that sends data to the **Register** action in the **CustomerController**. The form uses the POST HTTP verb.

**Using the Html.BeginForm() Helper**

``` Razor
@using (Html.BeginForm("Register", "Customer", FormMethod.Post)) 
{    
  @* Place input controls here *@ 
}
```

### **Using Forms to Post Files**

In HTML, if you want to enable website users to upload files, you should use an HTML form with special properties. Specifically, the **\<form\>** element should include the **enctype** attribute set to the value **multipart/form-data** and the form must use the POST HTTP verb.

You can specify additional attributes for the **\<form\>** element by passing them in an **htmlAttributes** parameter as new objects. This is a good method to use to add the **enctype** attribute. If the form includes any uploaded files, you must set the **enctype** attribute to **multipart/form-data**.

The following code example shows how to render a file upload form that sends data to the **Create** action in the **ProductController**. The form uses the POST verb and sets the **enctype** attribute.

**Using the Html.BeginForm() Helper**

``` Razor
@using (Html.BeginForm("Create", "Photo", FormMethod.Post, new { enctype = "multipart/form-data" })) 
{    
  @* Place input controls here *@ 
}
```

**Question:** You have created a form with a file selector control that uses the GET method. You have set the **enctype** attribute to **multipart/form-data**, but when you try to access the file in the action method, an exception is thrown. What have you possibly done incorrectly?

### Using Editor Helpers

![](_/5-10.jpg)

Within HTML forms, there are many HTML input controls that you can use to gather data from users. In Razor views, the **Html.LabelFor()** and **Html.EditorFor()** helpers make it easy to render the most appropriate input controls for the properties of a model class. To understand how these helpers render HTML, you must first understand the HTML input controls. Some common HTML controls are described in the following table.

|Control |Example |Description |
|-|-|-|
|Text box |`<input type="text" name="Title">`|A singleline text box in which the user can enter a string. The name attribute is used to identify the entered value in the query string or to send form data by using the POST method.|
|Multiline text box |`<textarea name="Description " rows="20" cols="80"> `|A multiline text box in which the user can enter longer strings. |
|Check box |`<input type="checkbox"     name="ContactMe"> Please send me new offer details `| A check box submits a Boolean value. |

**Additional Reading:** For more information about all HTML form elements, go to: [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=288961&clcid=0x409](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=288961&amp;clcid=0x409)

#### **The Html.LabelFor() Helper**

The **Html.LabelFor()** helper is similar to the **Html.DisplayNameFor()** helper because it renders the name of the property that you specify, taking into account the **DisplayName** annotation if it is specified in the model class. However, unlike the **Html.DisplayNameFor()** helper, the **Html.LabelFor()** helper renders a **<label>** element.

The following code example renders a label for the **CreatedDate** property.

**Using the Html.LabelFor() Helper**

``` Razor
@Html.LabelFor(model => model.CreatedDate) 
```

#### **The Html.EditorFor() Helper**

The **Html.EditorFor()** helper renders HTML **\<input\>** elements and other form controls for properties from an model class. This helper renders the most appropriate element for each property data type. For example, the **Html.EditorFor()** helper renders **\<input type="text"\>** for a string property. If the string property is annotated with **[DataType(DataType.MultilineText)]**, the **Html.EditorFor()** helper renders a **\<textarea\>** element instead. The following table describes the HTML that **Html.EditorFor()** renders for different model classes.

|Control |Model Class Property |HTML Rendered by EditorFor() |
|-|-|-|
|Text box |`public string Title { get; set; }` | `<input type="text" name="Title">` |
|Multi-line text box |`[DataType(DataType.MultilineText)] public string Description { get; set;} `|`<textarea name="Description"    rows="20" cols="80"> `|
|Check box |`[Display(Name = "Please send me new offer details")] public bool ContactMe { get; set; } `|`<input type="checkbox"     name="ContactMe">    Please send me new offer details.`|

If the action passes an existing model object to the view, the **Html.EditorFor()** helper also populates each control with the current values of each property.

The following code example renders a check box for the **ContactMe** property.

**Using the Html.EditorFor() Helper**

``` Razor
@Html.EditorFor(model => model.ContactMe) 
```

**Question:** You have a property in the **Product** model class named **ProductID**. You want to include this in the HTML page so that client-side script can use the **ProductID** value. However, you do not want the value to be displayed to users. In the model class, you have annotated the **ProductID** property with the **[HiddenInput(DisplayValue=false)]** attribute. How will the **Html.EditorFor()** helper render this property?

#### Using Validation Helpers

When you request information from users, you often want the data they enter in a certain format for further use in the web application. For example, you might want to ensure that users enter a value for the **LastName** property. You might also want to ensure that users enter a valid email address for the **EmailAddress** property. You can set these requirements by using validation data annotations in the model class. In controller actions, you can check the **ModelState.IsValid** property to verify if a user has entered valid data.

When users submit a form, if they have entered invalid data, most websites display validation messages. These messages are often highlighted in red, but other colors or formats can be used. Often, there is a validation summary at the top of the page such as Please enter valid information for the following fields: Last Name, Email Address. The form may display detailed validation messages next to each control in which the user entered invalid data, or highlight the problems in user supplied data with an asterisk.

When your MVC view displays a form, you can easily show validation messages by using the validation helpers. Validation helpers render HTML only when users have entered invalid data.

#### **The Html.ValidationSummary() Helper**

Use the **Html.ValidationSummary()**helper to render a summary of all the invalid data in the form. This helper is usually called at the top of the form. When the user submits invalid data, the validation messages are displayed for each invalid field in a bulleted list. You can control the validation messages in the model class by using this syntax in the annotation:

``` Razor
[Required(ErrorMessage="Please enter your last name")]
```

The following code example renders a summary of validation messages.

**Using the Html.ValidationSummary() Helper**

``` Razor
@Html. ValidationSummary()
```

#### **The Html.ValidationMessageFor() Helper**

Use the **Html.ValidationMessageFor()** helper to render validation messages next to each input in the form.

The following code example renders a validation message for the **LastName** property of the model class.

**Using the Html.ValidationMessageFor() Helper**

``` Razor
@Html.ValidationMessageFor(model => model.LastName)
```
