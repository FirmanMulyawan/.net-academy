## Module Overview

Many web applications need to display large amount of information and graphics. Large volumes of data make web applications take longer to load. Instead of having all the elements on the page load multiple times, you can implement caching in your web applications to reduce the need to repeatedly load the same elements. You can also use partial page updates to reduce the need to load the entire webpage, by enabling the application to refresh only specific sections of the webpage.

### Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Implement partial page updates that help reduce the need to reload entire pages.

- Implement caching to reduce the loading time of the different elements of a webpage.
