## Module Overview

ASP.NET MVC provides functionalities that help develop web applications. However, ASP.NET MVC does not include functionalities that help change the encoding of the output. In such cases, you need to know how to use an HTTP module or HTTP handler, to facilitate such specific requests. Most web applications require two-way communication between the client and server systems. The web sockets protocol facilitates two-way communications in a robust manner.

### Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Use HTTP modules and HTTP handlers.

- Use web sockets.
