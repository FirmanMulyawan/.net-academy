Authentication is a vital requirement in most web-based applications. Developers usually display only restricted information to all users. Web applications require users to authenticate themselves to view exclusive information. Web applications also display specific information that is relevant to specific user roles. Microsoft ASP.NET 4.5 includes various authentication models, including local authentication providers, claim-based authentication systems, and federated authentication systems. You need to know how to use these authentication models to implement authentication functionality in your web application. You should also know how to authorize users and roles in your application to restrict information access according to user and rolemembership.
