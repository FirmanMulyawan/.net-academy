# Module 09 Review and Takeaways <br> Building Responsive Pages in ASP.NET MVC 5 Web Applications

In this module, you used AJAX and partial page updates in MVC applications. AJAX and partial page updates help reduce the need for reloading the entire page, when a user places a request. Partial page updates also reduce the need for writing multiple lines of code, to update specific portions of a webpage. You also used caching to increase the performance of a web application.

## **Real-world Issues and Scenarios**

Web applications usually run multiple queries to retrieve information from a database and render content on the webpages. Users sometimes complain that webpages take longer to load. Therefore, developers implement caching in the web application, to reduce the need to load data from a database, every time a user places a request. Caching helps webpages load faster, thereby increasing the performance of the application.

## **Review Question(s)**

**Question:** An application is refreshing the content every 10 seconds for the updated information from database. User complaints that this is impacting their work and has caused data loss. How would you propose to help resolve this issue?
