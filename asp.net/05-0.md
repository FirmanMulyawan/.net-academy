## Module Overview

Views are one of the three major components of the MVC programming model. You can construct the user interface for your web application by writing views. A view is a mixture of HTML markup and code that runs on the web server. You need to know how to write the HTML and code found in a view and use the various helper classes built into MVC. You also need to know how to write partial views, which render sections of HTML that can be re-used in many places in your web application. The knowledge of creating views will help you develop webpages that present dynamic content.

### Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Create an MVC view and add Razor markup to it to display data to users.

- Use HTML helpers in a view to render controls, links, and other HTML elements.

- Re-use Razor markup in multiple locations throughout an application.
