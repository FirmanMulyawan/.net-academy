# Project Week 4 Day 1

## Building Your First Web Page

As web designers and front-end developers, we have the luxury of attending a number of great conferences dedicated to our craft. We’re going to make up our own conference, Styles Conference, and build a website for it throughout the following lessons. Here we go!

#### Step 1.

Let’s open our text editor, create a new file named *index.html*, and save it to a location we won’t forget.

#### Step 2.

Within the *index.html* file, let’s add the document structure, including the `<!DOCTYPE html>` document type and the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### Step 3.

Inside the `<head>` element, let’s add `<meta>` and `<title>` elements. The `<meta>` element should include the proper charset attribute and value, while the `<title>` element should contain the title of the page—let’s say “Styles Conference.”

``` html
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Styles Conference</title>
</head>
```

#### Step 4.

Inside the `<body>` element, let’s add `<h1>` and `<p>` elements. The `<h1>` element should include the heading we wish to include—let’s use “Styles Conference” again—and the `<p>` element should include a simple paragraph to introduce our conference.

``` html
<body>
  <h1>Styles Conference</h1>
  <p>Every year the brightest web designers and front-end developers descend on Chicago to discuss the latest technologies. Join us this August!</p>
</body>
```

#### Step 5.

Now it’s time to see how we’ve done! Let’s go find our *index.html* file. Double-clicking this file or dragging it into a web browser will open it for us to review.

#### Step 6.

Inside of our “styles-conference” folder, let’s create a new folder named “assets.” We’ll store all of the assets for our website, such as our style sheets, images, videos, and so forth, in this folder. For our style sheets, let’s go ahead and add another folder named “stylesheets” inside the “assets” folder.

#### Step 7.

Using our text editor, let’s create a new file named *main.css* and save it within the “stylesheets” folder we just created.

#### Step 8.

Looking at our index.html file in a web browser, we can see that the `<h1>` and `<p>` elements each have default CSS styles. Specifically, they each have a unique font size and spacing around them. Using Eric Meyer’s reset, we can tone down these styles, allowing each of them to be styled from the same base. To do this let’s head over to Eric’s website, copy his reset, and paste it at the top of our *main.css* file.

``` css
/* http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/ 2. v2.0 | 20110126
  License: none (public domain)
*/

html, body, div, span, applet, object, iframe,
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, blockquote, pre,
a, abbr, acronym, address, big, cite, code,
del, dfn, em, img, ins, kbd, q, s, samp,
small, strike, strong, sub, sup, tt, var,
b, u, i, center,
dl, dt, dd, ol, ul, li,
fieldset, form, label, legend,
table, caption, tbody, tfoot, thead, tr, th, td,
article, aside, canvas, details, embed,
figure, figcaption, footer, header, hgroup,
menu, nav, output, ruby, section, summary,
time, mark, audio, video {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  border: 0;
  font-size: 100%;
  font: inherit;
  vertical-align: baseline;
}
/* HTML5 display-role reset for older browsers */
article, aside, details, figcaption, figure,
footer, header, hgroup, menu, nav, section {
  display: block;
}
body {
  line-height: 1;
}
ol, ul {
  list-style: none;
}
blockquote, q {
  quotes: none;
}
blockquote:before, blockquote:after,
q:before, q:after {
  content: '';
  content: none;
}
table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
  border-spacing: 0;
}
```

#### Step 9.

With our *main.css* file starting to take shape, let’s connect it to our *index.html* file. Opening the *index.html* file in our text editor, let’s add the `<link>` element within our `<head>` element, just after the `<title>` element.

#### Step 10.

Because we’ll be referencing a style sheet within the `<link>` element, let’s add the relation attribute, `rel`, with a value of stylesheet.

#### Step 11.

We also want to include a hyperlink reference, using the `href` attribute, to our *main.css* file. Remember, our *main.css* file is saved within the “stylesheets” folder, which is inside the “assets” folder. Therefore, the `href` attribute value, which is the path to our *main.css* file, needs to be `assets/stylesheets/main.css`.

``` html
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Styles Conference</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/stylesheets/main.css">
</head>
```

#### Step 12.

Time to check out our work and see if our HTML and CSS are getting along. Now opening our index.html file (or refreshing the page if it’s already opened) within a web browser should show slightly different results than before.

## Getting to Know HTML

Currently, our Styles Conference website lacks real structure—and content for that matter. Let’s take some time to flesh out our home page a bit.

#### Step 1.

Using our existing *index.html* file, let’s add in a `<header>` element. Our `<header>` element should include our existing `<h1>` element; let’s also add an `<h3>` element as a tagline to support our `<h1>` element.

``` html
<header>
  <h1>Styles Conference</h1>
  <h3>August 24&ndash;26th &mdash; Chicago, IL</h3>
</header>
```

#### Step 2.

After our `<header>` element, let’s add a new group of content, using the `<section>` element, that introduces our conference. We’ll begin this section with a new `<h2>` element and end it with our existing paragraph.

``` html
<section>
  <h2>Dedicated to the Craft of Building Websites</h2>
  <p>Every year the brightest web designers and front-end developers descend on Chicago to discuss the latest technologies. Join us this August!</p>
</section>
```

#### Step 3.

Following the introduction to our conference, let’s add another group of content that teases a few of the pages we’ll be adding, specifically the Speakers, Schedule, and Venue pages. Each of the pages we’re teasing should also reside within its own section and include supporting text.

We’ll group all of the teasers inside a `<section>` element, and each individual teaser will be wrapped within a `<section>` element as well. In all, we’ll have three `<section>` elements inside another `<section>` element, which is all right.

``` html
<section>

  <section>
    <h5>Speakers</h5>
    <h3>World-Class Speakers</h3>
    <p>Joining us from all around the world are over twenty fantastic speakers, here to share their stories.</p>
  </section>

  ...

</section>
```

#### Step 4.

Lastly, let’s add our copyright within the <footer> element at the end of our page. To do so let’s use the <small> element, which semantically represents side comments and small print—perfect for our copyright.

Generally, content within the <small> element will be rendered as, well, small, but our CSS reset will prevent that from happening.

``` html
<footer>
  <small>&copy; Styles Conference</small>
</footer>
```

Now we can see our home page beginning to come to life.

![](http://learn.shayhowe.com/assets/images/courses/html-css/getting-to-know-html/practice-1.png)

#### Step 5.

We’ll begin by making our “Styles Conference” text inside the `<h1>` element within our `<header>` element link to the *index.html* page.

Because we are already on the *index.html* page, this may seem a little odd—and rightfully so—but as the header is replicated on other pages, linking back to the home page will make sense.

``` html
<h1>
  <a href="index.html">Styles Conference</a>
</h1>
```

#### Step 6.

In order to navigate across all of the different pages, we’re going add in a navigation menu, using the `<nav>` element, within our `<header>` element. We’ll be creating Speakers, Schedule, Venue, and Register pages to go with our home page, so we should create links for all of them.

``` html
<header>

  ...

  <nav>
    <a href="index.html">Home</a>
    <a href="speakers.html">Speakers</a>
    <a href="schedule.html">Schedule</a>
    <a href="venue.html">Venue</a>
    <a href="register.html">Register</a>
  </nav>

</header>
```

#### Step 7.

Let’s also add the same navigation menu from our `<header>` element to our `<footer>` element for convenience.

``` html
<footer>

  ...

  <nav>
    <a href="index.html">Home</a>
    <a href="speakers.html">Speakers</a>
    <a href="schedule.html">Schedule</a>
    <a href="venue.html">Venue</a>
    <a href="register.html">Register</a>
  </nav>

</footer>
```

#### Step 8.

Within the `<section>` element that introduces our conference, just below our header, we should also include a link to register for the conference. Placing a link below the paragraph will work perfectly.

``` html
<section>

  ...

  <a href="register.html">Register Now</a>

</section>
```

#### Step 9.

We can’t forget to add links to all of the sections teasing our other pages. Inside each section, let’s wrap both the `<h3>` and `<h5>` elements within an anchor element linking to the proper page.

We’ll want to make sure we do this for every section accordingly.

``` html
<section>

  <section>
    <a href="speakers.html">
      <h5>Speakers</h5>
      <h3>World-Class Speakers</h3>
    </a>
    <p>Joining us from all around the world are over twenty fantastic speakers, here to share their stories.</p>
  </section>

  ...

</section>
```

#### Step 10.

Now we need to create a handful of new pages. Let’s create *speakers.html*, *schedule.html*, *venue.html*, and *register.html* files. These files should live within the same folder as the *index.html* file, and, because we’re keeping them inside the same folder, all of our links should work as expected.

To ensure that all of our pages look the same, let’s make sure that all of these new files have the same document structure and `<header>` and `<footer>` elements as the *index.html* file.

It’s official, we’re no longer working with a single page but indeed a full website.

## Opening the Box Model

Let’s jump back into our Styles Conference website to center it on the page and add some more content.

#### Step 1.

Let’s start by adjusting our box size to use the `border-box` version of the box model, which will make sizing all of our elements much easier. Within our *main.css* file, just below our reset, let’s add a comment to identify the code for what will become our grid and help determine the layout of our website. We’re putting this below our reset so that it falls in the proper position within the cascade.

From there, we can use the universal selector, `*`, along with universal pseudo-elements, `*:before` and `*:after`, to select every imaginable element and change the `box-sizing` to `border-box`. Remember, we’re going to want to include the necessary vendor prefixes for the `box-sizing` property, as it is a relatively new property.

``` css
/*
  ========================================
  Grid
  ========================================
*/

*,
*:before,
*:after {
  -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
     -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
          box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

#### Step 2.
