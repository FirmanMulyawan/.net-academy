# Hands on Lab Week 10 Day 2 <br>Table Operations: Schemas, Constraint, and Keys

## Scenario 1: Two Different Schema with Same TableName

- Beth asks Troy to create two identical tables for two different organizations.<br>
  1) OrangeInc.<br>
  2) AlmondInc.
- Name of the table: Employee
	- ID (Int)
	- EmployeeName (varchar(256))
	- age (Int)

#### Step 1 Create new Schema
Let's see how we can create new schema and create new table under it. Now we have to create two different schemas. First we will create schema for OrangeInc. Right-click over __Schemas__, and click on __Create > Schema__.

It will bring up this familiar screen. Over here type name of the schema, and click on __OK__. Next we will create schema for AlmondInc. Once again, right-click over schemas, and click on New Schema. Over here type in name of your schema, and click on __OK__. If you do not see your schema immediately, click Schemas and right-click, and once again select __Refresh__.

#### Step 2 Create table `Employee` in `AlmondInc` schema
Now you will see all your schemas over here. Now we'll further expand AlmondInc, and under Tables we will create table called `Employee`. The owner of the schema is selected as AlmondInc over here. In this dropdown you can select any other schema as well; however, we'll keep AlmondInc as it is and click on __Columns__. Add here your columns, and here we have column information entered in my table. Click __OK__, and `Employee` table is successfully created under AlmondInc.

#### Step 3 Create table `Employee` in `OrangeInc` schema
 Let's change this AlmondInc to OrangeInc and now execute this statement. Select it, and click on this play button over here, which will execute query. Query returned successfully.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE "OrangeInc"."Employee"
(
    "ID" integer,
    "EmployeeName" character varying(256),
    "Age" integer
)
```

   ![](/images/w10d2-4.png)

You can see we have table `Employee` existing in OrangeInc schema, as well as in AlmondInc schema. It's very common to have a similar structure when a database contains data for multiple customers or accounts. Sometimes it's not possible to maintain different table names. It will be much easier if we have different schemas and each schema has its own object. In this scenario we have seen advantages of multiple schemas. Next, we will see what is a constraint and different types of it with the help of example.

## Scenario 2: Check Constraint and Error

- Beth asks Troy to make sure that column Age in Employee table of OrangeInc schema only accepts positive integers
- Name of the table: Employee
	- Age (Int)
	- Apply constraint to accept positive values

Here is the story. Beth asks Troy to make sure that column Age in Employee table of OrangeInc schema only accepts positive integers. Well, if you look at it, it does make sense. Age of the person can be 0 or more, but it cannot be ever in negative; hence, Beth has put this request to Troy. Now Troy's responsibility is to go to Employee table in OrangeInc schema and look at column Age. The data type of column Age is integer, but integer can also accept negative value. To prevent entering negative value in Age column, Troy has to put a constraint on Age column on Employee table. Let's go to pgAdmin 4 and help Troy to create this constraint.

#### Step 1 Insert data

```SQL
INSERT INTO "OrangeInc"."Employee"(
	"ID", "EmployeeName", "Age")
	VALUES (1, 'Spencer Brown', 25);

INSERT INTO "OrangeInc"."Employee"(
	"ID", "EmployeeName", "Age")
	VALUES (2, 'Steve Smith', -9);

SELECT * FROM "OrangeInc"."Employee";
```

#### Step 2 Constraint Create &rArr; Check &rArr; General
Here right below columns there is a section for constraints. Currently there are 0 constraints. Right-click over here, and click on New Object and select New Check as an option. It will bring up this screen where we can create New Check constraint. Let's give a name of this constraint as `PositiveAge`, and right after that click on Definition. Over here we will provide condition, which we want this column to follow. Our requirement currently is that column `Age` should only accept positive values.

#### Step 3 Constraint Create &rArr; Check &rArr; Definition
Here right below columns there is a section for constraints. Currently there are 0 constraints. Right-click over here, and click on New Object and select New Check as an option. It will bring up this screen where we can create New Check constraint. Let's give a name of this constraint as `PositiveAge`, and right after that click on __Definition__. Over here we will provide condition, which we want this column to follow. Our requirement currently is that column Age should only accept positive values. Over here we have to make decision if we want to allow 0 or not. Well, let's make a decision that we will allow value 0 in our column. That means column `Age` should be either greater than or equal to 0.

   ![](/images/w10d2-7.png)

#### Step 4 Constraint Create &rArr; Check &rArr; SQL
This is the condition for the constraint. Click on SQL. It will show you script which you can execute on your server, and it will also create constraint.

   ![](/images/w10d2-8.png)

Now click on __OK__, and it gives us error check constraint "PositiveAge" is violated by some row.
This is because we have already a single row in our table where we have age is less than 0. Here is a very important lesson to learn. You cannot create any constraint if there are already values in that column which are violating that constraint.

   ![](/images/w10d2-9.png)

Now let's go back to our Query Tool and delete all the rows. Select the `DELETE` statement and click on __Execute__.

```SQL
 DELETE FROM "OrangeInc"."Employee";
```

When we `SELECT * FROM this table`, it returns us no row; hence, our table is now empty. In the real world, you should plan an appropriate logic for all the rows which violates your constraint before you create one. Now let's go back to pgAdmin 4. Over here click on __OK__ one more time, and this time it creates constraint successfully. You can see name of constraint over here. Click here, and it will display SQL script to generate this constraint in SQL pane. You can execute this SQL to create this constraint as well.

   ![](/images/w10d2-10.png)

Now we will go to second `INSERT` statement where we have employee name as Steve Smith and age of the employee is -9. When we execute this statement, it will give us an error. The error is new row for relation "Employee" violates check constraint, and the name of the check constraint is "PositiveAge".

## Scenario 3: NOT-NULL Constraint

- Beth asks Troy to make sure that column Age in Employee table of OrangeInc schema only accepts Not-Null values
- Name of the table: Employee
  - Age(Int)
  - Apply constraint to accept not null values

#### Step 1 Set constraint column `ID` as `NOT NULL`
Execute query below.

```SQL
ALTER TABLE "OrangeInc"."Employee" ALTER COLUMN "Age" SET NOT NULL;
```

## Scenario 4: Unique Constraint and Error

- Beth asks Troy to make sure that there are not two employees with the same ID in the Employee Table of AlmondInc.
- Name of the table: Employee
  - ID (Int)
  - Apply unique constraint on column ID

#### Step 1 Set constraint column `ID` as `UNIQUE`
Execute query below

```SQL
 ALTER TABLE "OrangeInc"."Employee" ADD CONSTRAINT "UniqueID" UNIQUE ("ID");
```

This means we have successfully created unique constraint on column `ID`. Beth will be very delighted as so far every single task Troy has completed efficiently. Next Beth is going to make things a little bit more complex by giving task related to primary keys and foreign keys to Troy. Let's see how Troy performs when he is given complicated task which involves more than one table.

## Scenario 5: Primary Key

- Beth asks Troy to make sure that there are no two employees with the same ID in the Employee table of AlmondInc schema. Additionally, ID column should not allow null values as well

- Name of the table: Employee
	- ID (int)
	- Apply unique constraint on column ID
	- Apply Not-Null constraint on column ID
	- OR
	- Create Primary Key on column ID

#### Step 1 Set column `ID` as Primary Key
Execute query below.

```SQL
ALTER TABLE "AlmondInc"."Employee" ADD PRIMARY KEY ("ID");
```

## Scenario 6: Foreign Key

- Beth asks Troy to create another table EmployeeEquipment following relational theory and asks to retrieve name of the employee and equipment assigned.
- Name of the table: Employee and EmployeeEquipment
	- Follow relational theory
	- Retrieve data from both the tables

#### Step 1 Set Foreign Key in table `EmployeeEquipment`
Execute query below.

```SQL
ALTER TABLE "AlmondInc"."EmployeeEquipment"
	ADD CONSTRAINT "FKCont"
	FOREIGN KEY ("EmployeeID")
	REFERENCES "AlmondInc"."Employee" ("ID") MATCH FULL;
```

#### Step 2 Retrieve data
Retrieve data from table `Employee` and `EmployeEquipment` using `JOIN`.

```SQL
 SELECT e."EmployeeName", eq."Equipment"
    FROM "AlmondInc"."Employee" AS e
    INNER JOIN "AlmondInc"."EmployeeEquipment" AS eq
    	ON e."ID" = eq."EmployeeID"
```
