## Changing Instance - level Properties with SSMS

4. Click the Memory node. Under Server Memory Options, enter the amount that you want for Minimum server memory and Maximum server memory. Use the default settings to allow SQL Server to change its memory requirements dynamically based on available system resources. The default setting for min server memory is 0, and the default setting for max server memory is 2147483647 megabytes (MB).

5. The next set of options I will be looking into are the ones located in the Processors node.You can see that there are 4 available processors in this computer.SQL Server supports many processors and takes advantage of their power.

6. In the next node we will look into settings regarding Security in SQL Server. If you choose to have SQL Server Authentication you would have to keep credentials for your windows domain and SQL Server.When using the SQL Server Authentication make sure you create a long __sa__ password and hide it.

	In any case you need to have this authentication mode enabled especially if you need to provide access to your users outside the organisation. SQL Server Authentication does not require a domain controller.

7. The next set of options I will be looking into are the ones located in the Connections node. You can also allow remote connections to the server.The default value is 600 seconds, that means 10 minutes. Do enable this option if you need it. Do not change the default value.

8. The next set of options I will be looking into are the ones located in the Database Settings tab. We can also change the Data Default locations option if we choose to.I do not see any reason why you want to change that.This is a setting that you change without fear that you will break something.

9. The next set of options I will be looking into are the ones located in the Advanced node. There are many options we can set in this node. One of them is __Allow triggers to fire others__.This option is on by default. What actually means is that a trigger will allow to fire another trigger.Sometimes if we are not careful with that option we can get in an infinite loop. Another very important setting is the Optimize for Ad hoc Workloads.

	There is a setting that can be configured in SQL Server to approach such issues when we have lots of adhoc queries.It is called Optimize for Ad Hoc Workloads and you can enable it by using the system stored procedure sp_configure. By default this setting is off.When enabling this feature you must keep in mind that it will affect newly created plans and not the ones that are already placed in the plan cache.

	If you finish configure, please click tab Script then choose __Script action new query window__ and click __OK__ to end.
