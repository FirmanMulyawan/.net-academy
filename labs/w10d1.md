# Hands on Lab Week 10 Day 1

## Scenario 1: Create a table with Different Data Types

  ![](/images/w10d1-1.png)

- Beth asks Troy to create a table to store employee data with four columns.
- Name of the table: Employee
    - ID (Int)
    - EmployeeName (Varchar(256))
    - Age (Int)
    - Birthdate (Date)

#### Step 1 - Open pgAdmin
Here we are in __pgAdmin 4__. On the left side we see __Object Explorer__, and right over here there are two different servers which are listed.  Double-click over here, and it will bring up __Connect to Server__ prompt. Enter valid password, and click on OK. It will connect us to Postgres server. Right under Databases section, we can see two different databases, `OurSampleDB`, and `postgres`. We will create our table under `OurSampleDB` database.

#### Step 2 - Create table
Now click on the plus sign right besides Tables, and it will expand section of Tables. We will create our `Employee` table over here. Right-click over Tables, and select __Create > Table__ option. It will bring up this screen.

#### Step 3 - Create table columns
Click on tab labeled as Columns. Currently this section is empty as we have not created any columns in this table.

Click on __Add (+)__, and it will bring up prompt to create columns in this table. We will first create column `ID`, and we will select data type of this column as integer. To select data type, click on this dropdown menu, and scroll down a little bit down. Over here there is option of integer.

Next, create column `EmployeeName`, `Age` and `Birthdate` based on scenario above. If you finished, click button __Save__.

#### Step 4 - Save table and check structure table

   ![](/images/w10d1-5.png)

Well, by just creating table `Employee` and four columns with specific data types, Troy has completed the task given by Beth. Well, Beth was definitely delighted as Troy has completed first task successfully.

## Scenario 2: Create New Column Accepting Yes/No

- Beth ask Troy to add new column to Employee table, which indicates if employee is current or not.
- Name of the table: Employee
    - IsCurrentEmployee (Option: Yes/No)

#### Step 1 - Create new column
We have to add a new column over here. Right-click over Columns, and it will bring up this menu. Select New Column, and you will see this screen.

Enter the name of column over here, and now we have to select appropriate data type which can accept Yes or No for this column. Click over here, and here is the list of various data types. Scroll up, and now select data type as `bit`. This means now this column will select either 1 or 0.

   ![](/images/Scenario2-step1a.png)

   ![](/images/Scenario2-step1b.png)

   ![](/images/Scenario2-step1c.png)

If in the future we ever need to store a third value in this column, at that point in time we can change this `bit` to `integer` or `string` and change our logic appropriately.

#### Step 2 - Save table changes and check stucture table
Click __OK__, and now new column is added in `Employee` table.

   ![](/images/Scenario2-step2.png)

Well, this task was a little bit more complicated than before as Troy has to make the right decision for data type as well. As we helped Troy to select proper data type, Beth was definitely pleased with the performance of Troy.

## Scenario 3: Data Type and Default Values

- Beth asks Troy to add default to the column IsCurrentEmployee and make it compulsory for every record.
- Name of the table: Employee
    - Change property of IsCurrentEmployee column
        - Not Null and
        - Default Value to Yes

We have just added column IsCurrentEmployee. When we select this column, on the right side in SQL pane we can see script which can generate this column. We used __pgAdmin 4__ to add this column, but alternatively you can execute this particular script from command prompt or in Query Tool and add Employee column as well. Now Beth has requested Troy to make this IsCurrentEmployee a required column, as well as also once default value for IsCurrentEmployee column.

   ![](/images/Scenario3-step1.png)

#### Step 1 - Set property column`IsCurrentEmployee` Not Null and Set default value to Yes then Save table changes and check stucture table

   ![](/images/Scenario3-step2.png)

Now let's go back to Query Tool, and this time we will attempt to insert new row where we will not specify `IsCurrentEmployee` value. As we have seen earlier, if we do not specify this column, our insert was failing with an error. However, now as we have specified default value for the column, if we do not specify this particular column, the `INSERT` will still work, and column will contain default value automatically.

   ![](/images/Scenario3-step3.png)

 Let's check that by inserting this new row. Select the statement, and click on __Execute__. Query required successfully: one row affected. That means we have successfully inserted row where ID is 3. Let's see what is the value for `IsCurrentEmployee` column, which we had not specified in this `INSERT` statement. To check that, execute the statement, and here is the result set. This is the row which we have just inserted. If you carefully observe, the last column `IsCurrentEmployee` contains value 1.

## Scenario 4: Incorrect Data Type and Problems

- Beth asks to create a new table containing details of customer to Troy but this time she does not provide guidance for data type.
- Name of the table: Customer
	- Name
	- Birthdate
	- Zipcode
- Tasks: Later on Beth asks Troy to complete following tasks
  - 1) Search for specific zipcode
  - 2) Display everybody born in the month of January

#### Step 1 - Create a new table `Customer`

Right over here further expand Tables. Right-click on Tables node, and click on __Create > Table__. Here is the screen which Troy has used earlier.

   ![](/images/Scenario4-step1a.png)

Then Save table changes and check structure table, click __Save__.

   ![](/images/Scenario4-step1b.png)

#### Step 2 - `INSERT` script for `Customer` table

Troy is inserting seven different rows in this table. Select all the `INSERT` scripts, and click on __Execute__.

```SQL
> INSERT INTO "Customer"(
>     "Name","Birthdate","Zipcode")
>     VALUES ('Mike','June 6, 1976',01256);
>     
> INSERT INTO "Customer"(
>     "Name","Birthdate","Zipcode")
>     VALUES ('John','6 Jan, 1986',00256);
>    
> INSERT INTO "Customer"(
>     "Name","Birthdate","Zipcode")
>     VALUES ('Duke','January 16, 1996',12958);
>     
> INSERT INTO "Customer"(
>     "Name","Birthdate","Zipcode")
>     VALUES ('Vikky','01/01/2001',00001);
>
> INSERT INTO "Customer"(
>     "Name","Birthdate","Zipcode")
>     VALUES ('Martha','14/1/76',01559);
>     
> INSERT INTO "Customer"(
>     "Name","Birthdate","Zipcode")
>     VALUES ('Alex','1/14/76',01256);
```

He will populate the table `Customer` with random data, which he was provided. Here is the `INSERT` script for `Customer` table. Troy is inserting seven different rows in this table. Select all the `INSERT` scripts, and click on __Execute__. Query returned successfully. That means all the `INSERT` statements are executed successfully. Let's write a `SELECT` statement and see our data in table `Customer`.

Select this statement, and click on __Execute__. In Output pane you can see seven different rows. Now as Troy has created table with three columns, Beth gives him two different tasks

   ![](/images/Scenario4-step1c.png)

## Scenario 5: Data Type and Default Values

- Beth helps Troy with correct data type with newly created table customer.
- Name of the table: Customer
    - Name (varchar)
    - Birthdate (date)
    - Zipcode (varchar)
- Tasks: Later on Troy realizes how it can help to complete following Tasks
  1. Search for specific zipcode
  2. Display everybody born in the month of January

#### Step 1 - Create table `Customer` in Query Tool
Open blank Query Tool. We will type our code to create table `Customer` by executing query below.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE "Customer"
(
  "Name" character varying(256),
  "Birthdate" date,
  "Zipcode" character varying(10)
)
```

Now let's select the statement and click on Execute. Query returned successfully. That means we have successfully created new table Customer

#### Step 2 - Insert data to table `Customer`
Now we will once again go back to Query Tool and insert sample data in our `Customer` table. Here is the code which we had previously used to insert data in `Customer` table.

```SQL
INSERT INTO "Customer"(
            "Name", "Birthdate", "Zipcode")
    VALUES ('Mike', 'June 6, 1976', '01256');
INSERT INTO "Customer"(
            "Name", "Birthdate", "Zipcode")
    VALUES ('John', '06-Jan-1986', '00256');
INSERT INTO "Customer"(
            "Name", "Birthdate", "Zipcode")
    VALUES ('Duke', 'January 16, 1996', '12958');
INSERT INTO "Customer"(
            "Name", "Birthdate", "Zipcode")
    VALUES ('Vikky', '01/01/2001', '00001');
```
> __Notes__<br>
> You can go to https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/datatype-datetime.html and see which are the valid input dates data type accepts

#### Step 3 - Check the table contents
We can check that by executing `SELECT * FROM "Customer"`.

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM "Customer";
```
When we execute the statement, we can see now we have four rows.

   ![](/images/Scenario5-step1.png)

 The first task was to retrieve all the customers where zip code starts with 0. We can easily find that with the help of `LIKE` keyword. Here is the script, `SELECT * FROM "Customer" WHERE "Zipcode" LIKE "0%"`.

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM "Customer"
WHERE "Zipcode" LIKE '0%';
```

When we execute this query, our result set will be filtered, and only rows where zip code starting with 0 will be displayed.

   ![](/images/Scenario5-step2.png)

The second task was to find out all the customers with birthday in __January__. We can execute second script very similar to what we have written a few seconds ago. Here is another script which we have returned to retrieve name of all the customers born in January.

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM "Customer"
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM "Birthdate") = 1;
```

And here is required result set.

   ![](/images/Scenario5-step3.png)

## Scenario 6: Data Type and Mac Address

Beth asks Troy to add a new column to Employee table where column will accept and store only valid Mac Address.

- Name of the table: Employee
  - MacAddress

> __Info__<br>
> __MAC address__ is an abbreviation of media access control address. It is a unique identifier assigned to network interface for communications on the physical network segment. In simple words, a computer can have one or more network cards, and based on number of network cards it may have MAC addresses. MAC addresses only uses hexadecimal numbers. That means it will accept 0 to 9 numbers and A to F alphabets.

#### Step 1 - Create a column Mac Address
On table `Employee`, right click then click on __ Create > Column__. It will bring up this familiar screen of adding new column.

   ![](/images/Scenario6-step1.png)

Over here type the name of column as `MacAddress`, and now let's see if we can find any data type which is suitable for our `MacAddress` column. Remember, if we cannot find suitable column, we will end up using `varchar` or `character varying` columns. Click on dropdown beside data type and start scanning and scrolling. Around midway we can see a data type which is called `macaddr`.

Let's check that by creating this new column.

   ![](/images/Scenario6-step2.png)

#### Step 2 - Insert a new record in `Employee` table
Now we will insert data in our table. For that, let's open Query Tool and click over here. In Query Tool we have returned an `INSERT` script, `INSERT INTO "Employee"` and name of all the columns. The last column is `MacAddress`, and here is a valid MAC address

```SQL
INSERT INTO "Employee"(
            "ID", "EmployeeName", "Age", "Birthdate","IsCurrentEmployee", "MacAddress")
    VALUES (6, 'Spencer', 35, '12/1/1975', B'1','08-00-2b-01-02-03');
```

Query returned successfully. That means `INSERT` was successful.

#### Step 3 - Check the table contents
Now let's check our data by `SELECT * FROM "Employee"`.

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM "Employee";
```

#### Step 4 - Insert a new record with invalid format of Mac Address
 Now let's change one of the values of our MAC addresses to invalid number. For example, here we will use letter `P`. `P` is not part of hexadecimal number, and when we execute this statement it should throw us an error.

```SQL
INSERT INTO "Employee"(
            "ID", "EmployeeName", "Age", "Birthdate","IsCurrentEmployee", "MacAddress")
    VALUES (6, 'Spencer', 35, '12/1/1975', B'1','p8-00-2b-01-02-03');
```

The error is invalid input syntax for type `macaddr`. MAC address will only take digits 0 to 9 and alphabets A to F. If you try to pass in any other number, MAC address data type will not accept that.
