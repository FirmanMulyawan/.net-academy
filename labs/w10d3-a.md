## Add Features to an Instance of SQL Server 2016 (Setup)

This topic provides a step-by-step procedure for adding features to an instance of SQL Server 2016. Some SQL Server components or services are specific to an instance of SQL Server. These are also known as instance-aware. They share the same version as the instance that hosts them, and are used exclusively for that instance. You can add the instance-aware components to an instance SQL Server, along with the shared components of if they are not already installed. For a list of features that are supported by the editions of SQL Server, see [Features Supported by the Editions of SQL Server 2016](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645993.aspx)

### Procedures
Prepare installation please [download SQL Server 2016 Edition Developer](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?PId=2057)__*__

> Note : you must have account!.

__To add features to an instance of SQL Server 2016__

1. Insert the SQL Server installation media. From the root folder, double-click setup.exe. To install from a network share, navigate to the root folder on the share, and then double-click setup.exe. If the SQL Server 2016 Setup dialog box appears, Click __OK__. to install the prerequisites, then click __Cancel__ to quit SQL Server 2016 installation.
2. The Installation Wizard will launch the SQL Server Installation Center. To add a new feature to an existing instance of SQL Server 2016, click __Installation__ in the left-hand navigation area, and then click __New SQL Server stand-alone installation or add features to an existing installation.__

4. On the Product Updates page, the latest available SQL Server product updates are displayed. If you don't want to include the updates, clear the __Include SQL Server product updates__ check box. If no product updates are discovered, SQL Server Setup does not display this page and auto advances to the __Install Setup Files page.__

5. On the Install Setup files page, Setup provides the progress of downloading, extracting, and installing the Setup files. If an update for SQL Server Setup is found, and is specified to be included, that update will also be installed. Click Install to install Setup Support files.
6. The System Configuration Checker will verify the system state of your computer before Setup continues.
7. On the Installation Type page, select the option __Add features to an existing instance of SQL Server 2016__, and select the instance you would like to update.

8. On the Feature Selection page, select the components for your installation. A description for each component group appears in the right-hand pane after you select the feature name. You can select any combination of check boxes. For more information, see [Editions and Components of SQL Server 2016](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms144275.aspx). Each component can be installed only once on a given instance of SQL Server. To install multiple components, you must install an additional instance of SQL Server.

	The prerequisites for the selected features are displayed on the right-hand pane. SQL Server Setup will install the prerequisite that are not already installed during the installation step described later in this procedure.

	The System Configuration Checker will verify the system state of your computer before Setup continues. Click __Next__ to continue.

9. The Disk Space Requirements page calculates the required disk space for the features you specify, and compares requirements to the available disk space on the computer where Setup is running.
10. Work flow for the remainder of this topic depends on the features you have specified for your installation. You might not see all of the pages, depending on your selections.
11. On the Server Configuration — Service Accounts page, specify login accounts for SQL Server services. The actual services that are configured on this page depend on the features you selected to install.

	You can assign the same login account to all SQL Server services, or you can configure each service account individually. You can also specify whether services start automatically, are started manually, or are disabled. Microsoft recommends that you configure service accounts individually to provide least privileges for each service, where SQL Server services are granted the minimum permissions they need to complete their tasks. For more information, see [Server Configuration - Service Accounts](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc281953.aspx) and [Configure Windows Service Accounts and Permissions.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143504.aspx)

	To specify the same login account for all service accounts in this instance of SQL Server, provide credentials in the fields at the bottom of the page.

	__Security Note__ : Do not use a blank password. Use a strong password.

	When you are finished specifying login information for SQL Server services, click __Next__.

12. Use the __Server Configuration - Collation__ tab to specify non-default collations for the Database Engine and Analysis Services. For more information, see Server Configuration - Collation.

13. Use the Database Engine Configuration — Account Provisioning page to specify the following:

	- Security Mode - Select Windows Authentication or Mixed Mode Authentication for your instance of SQL Server. If you select Mixed Mode Authentication, you must provide a strong password for the built-in SQL Server system administrator account.

		After a device establishes a successful connection to SQL Server, the security mechanism is the same for both Windows Authentication and Mixed Mode. For more information, see [Database Engine Configuration - Server Configuration.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc281849.aspx)

	- SQL Server Administrators — You must specify at least one system administrator for the instance of SQL Server. To add the account under which SQL Server Setup is running, click __Add Current User__. To add or remove accounts from the list of system administrators, click __Add__ or __Remove__, and then edit the list of users, groups, or computers that will have administrator privileges for the instance of SQL Server. For more information, see [Database Engine Configuration - Server Configuration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc281849.aspx)

	![](/images/w10d3-a7.png)

	When you are finished editing the list, click OK. Verify the list of administrators in the configuration dialog box. When the list is complete, click __Next.__

14. Use the Database Engine Configuration — Data Directories page to specify non-default installation directories. To install to default directories, click __Next.__


 	__Important__:
	If you specify non-default installation directories, ensure that the installation folders are unique to this instance of SQL Server. None of the directories in this dialog box should be shared with directories from other instances of SQL Server.

	For more information, see [Database Engine Configuration - Data Directories.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc281941.aspx)

15. Use the Database Engine Configuration — FILESTREAM page to enable FILESTREAM for your instance of SQL Server. For more information about FILESTREAM, see [Database Engine Configuration - Filestream](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc645996.aspx). To continue, click Next.

16. During installation, the Installation Progress page provides status so you can monitor installation progress as Setup proceeds.
17. After installation, the Complete page provides a link to the summary log file for the installation and other important notes. To complete the SQL Server installation process, click Close.
