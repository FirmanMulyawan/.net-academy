# Hands on Lab Week 3 Day 2

## Struct

1. Create a "struct" to store data of 2D points. The fields for each point will be: 

  x coordinate (short) 
  y coordinate (short) 
  r (red colour, byte) 
  g (green colour, byte) 
  b (blue colour, byte) 

  Write a program which creates two "points", asks the user for their data, and then displays their content.

2. Expand the previous exercise (struct point), so that up to 1.000 points can be stored, using an "array of struct". Ask the user for data for the first two points and then display them. 

## LINQ
