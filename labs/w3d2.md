# Hands on Lab Solution Week 3 Day 2

## Struct

**1.** Create a "struct" to store data of 2D points. The fields for each point will be: 

x coordinate (short)    
y coordinate (short)    
r (red colour, byte)    
g (green colour, byte)    
b (blue colour, byte)    

Write a program which creates two "points", asks the user for their data, and then displays their content.

<hr>

**2.** Expand the previous exercise (struct point), so that up to 1.000 points can be stored, using an "array of struct". Ask the user for data for the first two points and then display them. 

## LINQ

**1.** Write a program in C# to get the numbers which produce the remainder 0 after divided by 2.
*Test Data:*
```
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
```
*Expected Output:*
```
The numbers which produce the remainder 0 after divided by 2 are : 
0 2 4 6 8 
```

<hr>

**2.** Write a program in C# to find numbers greater than 0 and less than 11 from a list of numbers using two `where` conditions in LINQ Query.
*Test Data:*
```
1, 3, -2, -4, -7, -3, -8, 12, 19, 6, 9, 10, 14
```
*Expected Output:*
```
1 3 6 9 10
```

<hr>

**3.** Write a program in C# to display the number and frequency of number from giving array.    
*Test Data:*
```
5, 9, 1, 2, 3, 7, 5, 6, 7, 3, 7, 6, 8, 5, 4, 9, 6, 2
```
*Expected Output:*
```
Number 5 appears 3 times 
Number 9 appears 2 times 
Number 1 appears 1 times 
. . . .
```

<hr>

**4.** Write a program in C# to display the characters and frequency of character from giving string.    
*Test Data:*
```
Input the string : pen pineapple apple pen 
```
*Expected Output:*
```
Character p: 7 times 
Character e: 5 times 
Character n: 3 times 
Character i: 1 times
Character a: 2 times
Character l: 2 times
```

<hr>

**5.** Write a program in C# to find the string which starts and ends with a specific character.    
*Test Data:*
```
The cities are : 'ROME','LONDON','NAIROBI','CALIFORNIA','ZURICH','NEW DELHI','AMSTERDAM','ABU DHABI','PARIS' 
Input starting character for the string : A 
Input ending character for the string : M
```
*Expected Output:*
```
The city starting with A and ending with M is : AMSTERDAM
```

<hr>

**6.** Write a program in C# Sharp to find the uppercase words in a string.    
*Test Data:*
```
this IS a STRING 
```
*Expected Output:*
```
The UPPER CASE words are : 
IS 
STRING
```

## I/O

**1.** Write a program in C# that read all the text in a file and store it in a string.    

<hr>

**2.** Write a program in C# that read all the line of text in a file and store it in an array of string (one line per component).

<hr>

**3.** Write a program in C# that count the number of lines in a file.

<hr>

**4.** Write a program in C# that can find a keyword in a file.    
*Test Data:*
