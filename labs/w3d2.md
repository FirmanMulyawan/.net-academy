# Hands on Lab Week 3 Day 2

## Struct

**1.** Create a "struct" to store data of 2D points. The fields for each point will be: 

x coordinate (short)    
y coordinate (short)    
r (red colour, byte)    
g (green colour, byte)    
b (blue colour, byte)    

Write a program which creates two "points", asks the user for their data, and then displays their content.

---

**2.** Expand the previous exercise (struct point), so that up to 1.000 points can be stored, using an "array of struct". Ask the user for data for the first two points and then display them. 

## LINQ

**1.** Write a program in C# to get the numbers which produce the remainder 0 after divided by 2.
*Test Data:*
```
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
```
*Expected Output:*
```
The numbers which produce the remainder 0 after divided by 2 are : 
0 2 4 6 8 
```

---

**2.** Write a program in C# to find numbers greater than 0 and less than 11 from a list of numbers using two `where` conditions in LINQ Query.
*Test Data:*
```
1, 3, -2, -4, -7, -3, -8, 12, 19, 6, 9, 10, 14
```
*Expected Output:*
```
1 3 6 9 10
```

---

**3.** Write a program in C# Sharp to display the number and frequency of number from giving array.
*Test Data:*
```
5, 9, 1, 2, 3, 7, 5, 6, 7, 3, 7, 6, 8, 5, 4, 9, 6, 2
```
*Expected Output:*
```
Number 5 appears 3 times 
Number 9 appears 2 times 
Number 1 appears 1 times 
. . . .
```
