# Hands on Lab Week 11 Day 1

## Testing the model

Prepare testing you can download sample project, please click [here]().

#### A. Writing Unit Tests with Collaborators: Classical Style

1. __Install NUnit and NUnitTestAdapter in the Package Manager this your project__

Open the Packages Manager, click on __Tools__ Menu and choose __NuGet Package Manager__ and then choose __Manage Packages for Solution__.

![](/images/w11d1-1.png)

or you can install Package Manager via console, __Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console command.__

2. __Create new unit test project__

On the Solution Explorer, choose __Add__ and then choose __New Project.__

![](/images/w11d1-2.png)

In the New Project dialog box, expand the Installed node, choose the __Class Library__, give name __BankingSite.UnitTests__ then click __OK__.

3. __Install NUnit and NUnitTestAdapter in the Package Manager__

Can you add reference from Nuget, for this test project.

4. We're going to Add a New Class `CreditHistoryCheckerTests`,

On the Solution Explorer, choose __Add__ and then choose __Class.__

![](/images/w11d1-4.png)

In the New Project dialog box, expand the Installed node, choose the __Class__, give name `CreditHistoryCheckerTests` then click __OK__.

![](/images/w11d1-5.png)

 On the class `CreditHistoryCheckerTests`, write this the code.

```cs
	using BankingSite.Models;
	using NUnit.Framework;

	namespace BankingSite.UnitTests
	{
	    [TestFixture]
	    public class CreditHistoryCheckerTests
	    {
	        [Test]
	        public void ShouldRecognizePeopleWithBadCredit()
	        {
	            var sut = new CreditHistoryChecker();

	            var isCreditWorthy = sut.CheckCreditHistory("Sarah", "Smith");

	            Assert.That(isCreditWorthy, Is.False);
	        }

	        [Test]
	        public void ShouldOkPeopleWithGoodCredit()
	        {
	            var sut = new CreditHistoryChecker();

	            var isCreditWorthy = sut.CheckCreditHistory("Tom", "Smith");

	            Assert.That(isCreditWorthy, Is.True);            
	        }
	    }
	}
```

5. We're going to Add a New Class `LoanApplicationScorerTests`, how to create the same as for the class `CreditHistoryCheckerTests`.

We can see in the implementation here if I just come down to this `ValidateBasicCriteria`, we can see we either need the applications `AnnualIncome` to be more than $1,000,000, if it's less than $1,000,000 we need the applicant to be 21 years or older and if they're 21 years or older they pass our basic `LoanApplication` validation. So let's head back to our tests. Now we're created our application data, we can pass it into our System Under Test and get the result. So to do this, we're going to call the `LoanApplicationScorers ScoreApplication` method and pass in the application that we've just created.

```cs
	using BankingSite.Models;
	using NUnit.Framework;

	namespace BankingSite.UnitTests
	{
	    [TestFixture]
	    public class LoanApplicationScorerTests
	    {
	        [Test]
	        public void ShouldDeclineWhenNotTooYoungAndWealthyButPoorCredit_Classical()
	        {
	            var sut = new LoanApplicationScorer(new CreditHistoryChecker());

	            var application = new LoanApplication
	            {
	                // Need to specify criteria that will cause
	                // real CreditHistoryChecker to decline
	                FirstName = "Sarah",
	                LastName = "Smith",

	                AnnualIncome = 1000000.01m,
	                Age = 22
	            };

	            sut.ScoreApplication(application);

	            Assert.That(application.IsAccepted, Is.False);
	        }
	    }
	}
```

So the last thing we need to do to complete this test is to add an __Assert__. So here we want to Assert that the application that's passed in has been declined even though they pass to these basic tests of `AnnualIncome` and `Age`. So we're just going to say, `application.IsAccepted`, `Is.false`. So let's go up to our __Test Explorer__ and if we just build we'll see our test pop up, and we're going to right click on this test and just choose __Run Selected Test__, just so we don't have to run the other ones again.

#### B. Writing Unit Tests with Collaborators: Mockist Style

1. Install a mocking framework (Moq)

Install a mocking in the __NuGet Package Manager__ or with __console__
	`PM> Install-Package Moq`

2. Change Class `LoanApplicationScorerTests`

So let's take a look at how we can refactor our Classical Style Test into a __Mockist Style Test__. So to do this, we're going to need to install a mocking framework, so we're going to be installing an open source mocking framework called Moq and then we're going to write the test using a fake collaborator rather than the real one.

Create our instance of our `LoanApplicationScorer`, we'll need to create a mock version of our `ICreditHistoryChecker`. So to do this, we're going to use Moq. I'm just going to call this `fakeCreditHistoryChecker`, and it's here where we ask Moq to create a mock version of this for us. So to do this, we use the syntax and now Moq will create a fake version of an `ICreditHistoryChecker`.

```cs
	using BankingSite.Models;
	using Moq;
	using NUnit.Framework;

	namespace BankingSite.UnitTests
	{
	    [TestFixture]
	    public class LoanApplicationScorerTests
	    {
	        [Test]
	        public void ShouldDeclineWhenNotTooYoungAndWealthyButPoorCredit()
	        {
	            var fakeCreditHistoryChecker = new Mock<ICreditHistoryChecker>();

	            fakeCreditHistoryChecker.Setup(x => x.CheckCreditHistory(It.IsAny<string>(),It.IsAny<string>()))
	                .Returns(false);

	            var sut = new LoanApplicationScorer(fakeCreditHistoryChecker.Object);

	            var application = new LoanApplication
	            {
	                AnnualIncome = 1000000.01m,
	                Age = 22
	            };

	            sut.ScoreApplication(application);

	            Assert.That(application.IsAccepted, Is.False);
	        }
	    }
	}
```

### C. Writing Integration Tests

1. Create a new integration test project

We're going to see how we can write an integration test, which runs tests against an actual database. So in this demo we'll see that I've already created a new __Integration Test Class Library Project__ to hold our Integration Tests and we're going to go and create a new test class and add some tests to it to test against the database.

![](/images/w11d1-8.png)

2. We're going to Add a New Class `RepositoryTests`.

```cs
	using BankingSite.Models;
	using NUnit.Framework;

	namespace BankingSite.IntegrationTests
	{
	    [TestFixture]
	    public class RepositoryTests
	    {
	        [Test]
	        public void ShouldPopulateIdOnCreateLoanApplication()
	        {
	            var sut = new Repository();

	            var applicationToSave = new LoanApplication
	            {
	                FirstName = "Gentry",
	                LastName = "Smith",
	                Age = 33,
	                AnnualIncome = 12345.67m
	            };

	            sut.Create(applicationToSave);

	            Assert.That(applicationToSave.ID, Is.Not.EqualTo(0));
	        }
	    }
	}
```

##  Testing Controllers

#### A. Writing a Controller Test Manually

1. So if we head up and __Add a New Project__, again the Class Library project, and we'll just call this `BankingSiteControllerTests` and just hit OK, and we'll go and install NUnit to this. So we'll just head up to our __Package Manager Console__ and you could do this through the NuGet UI.

2.  We're going to Add a New Class __LoanApplicationControllerTests__

```cs
	using System.Web.Mvc;
	using BankingSite.Controllers;
	using BankingSite.Models;
	using Moq;
	using NUnit.Framework;

	namespace BankingSite.ControllerTests
	{
	    [TestFixture]
	    public class LoanApplicationControllerTests
	    {
	        [Test]
	        public void ShouldRenderDefaultView()
	        {
	            var fakerepository = new Mock<IRepository>();
	            var fakeLoanApplicationScorer = new Mock<ILoanApplicationScorer>();

	            var sut = new LoanApplicationController(fakerepository.Object, fakeLoanApplicationScorer.Object);

	            var result = sut.Apply() as ViewResult;

	            Assert.That(result.ViewName, Is.EqualTo("Apply"));

	        }
	    }
	}
```

#### B. Refactoring to Use FluentMVCTesting

1. Install FluentMVCTesting from NuGet. So we'll install the `teststack.fluentmvctesting` package and we'll install this into our `ControllerTest`'s project here. So now that's installed. We can go ahead and refactor this test. `PM> install-package teststack.fluentmvctesting`.

2. We're going to Change Class `LoanApplicationControllerTests`

```cs
	using System.Web.Mvc;
	using BankingSite.Controllers;
	using BankingSite.Models;
	using Moq;
	using NUnit.Framework;
	using TestStack.FluentMVCTesting;

	namespace BankingSite.ControllerTests
	{
	    [TestFixture]
	    public class LoanApplicationControllerTests
	    {
	        [Test]
	        public void ShouldRenderDefaultView()
	        {
	            var fakerepository = new Mock<IRepository>();
	            var fakeLoanApplicationScorer = new Mock<ILoanApplicationScorer>();

	            var sut = new LoanApplicationController(fakerepository.Object, fakeLoanApplicationScorer.Object);

	            sut.WithCallTo(x => x.Apply()).ShouldRenderDefaultView();
	        }
	    }
	}
```

#### C. Adding Additional `LoanApplicationController` Tests.

1. So let's add some additional tests now to our `LoanApplicationController` Tests class. So in our `LoanApplicationController` here, we have this __Apply__ action, which takes the `LoanApplication` model that's been input by the user and once we've checked for the model validity here, we're going to score the application and we're going to create the application using the repository.

2. We're going to Change Class `LoanApplicationControllerTests` here Code:

```cs
	using System.Web.Mvc;
	using BankingSite.Controllers;
	using BankingSite.Models;
	using Moq;
	using NUnit.Framework;
	using TestStack.FluentMVCTesting;

	namespace BankingSite.ControllerTests
	{
	    [TestFixture]
	    public class LoanApplicationControllerTests
	    {
	        [Test]
	        public void ShouldRenderDefaultView()
	        {
	            var fakerepository = new Mock<IRepository>();
	            var fakeLoanApplicationScorer = new Mock<ILoanApplicationScorer>();

	            var sut = new LoanApplicationController(fakerepository.Object, fakeLoanApplicationScorer.Object);

	            sut.WithCallTo(x => x.Apply()).ShouldRenderDefaultView();
	        }

	        [Test]
	        public void ShouldRedirectToAcceptedViewOnSuccessfulApplication()
	        {
	            var fakerepository = new Mock<IRepository>();
	            var fakeLoanApplicationScorer = new Mock<ILoanApplicationScorer>();

	            var sut = new LoanApplicationController(fakerepository.Object, fakeLoanApplicationScorer.Object);

	            var acceptedApplication = new LoanApplication
	            {
	                IsAccepted = true
	            };

	            sut.WithCallTo(x => x.Apply(acceptedApplication)).ShouldRedirectTo<int>(x => x.Accepted);
	        }

	        [Test]
	        public void ShouldRedirectToDeclinedViewOnUnsuccessfulApplication()
	        {
	            var fakerepository = new Mock<IRepository>();
	            var fakeLoanApplicationScorer = new Mock<ILoanApplicationScorer>();

	            var sut = new LoanApplicationController(fakerepository.Object, fakeLoanApplicationScorer.Object);

	            var declinedApplication = new LoanApplication
	            {
	                IsAccepted = false
	            };


	            sut.WithCallTo(x => x.Apply(declinedApplication))
	               .ShouldRedirectTo<int>(x => x.Declined);
	        }
	    }
	}
```

#### D. Adding `HomeController` Tests.

So we're going to start by adding a new class here and we're going to call this `HomeController` Tests.

```cs
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using BankingSite.Controllers;
using NUnit.Framework;
using TestStack.FluentMVCTesting;

namespace BankingSite.ControllerTests
{
    [TestFixture]
    public class HomeControllerTests
    {
        [Test]
        public void ShouldRedirectToPluralsightForContact()
        {
            var sut = new HomeController();

            sut.WithCallTo(x => x.Contact()).ShouldRedirectTo("http://pluralsight.com");
        }
    }
}
```

#### E. Adding `LoanApplicationSearchController` Tests

So we'll go and __add__ a new test class here and we'll call it `LoanApplicationSearchControllerTests` and we'll start with this Test method called `ShouldReturn404StatusWhenLoanIdNotExists` and  `ShouldRenderApplicationWhenIdExists`

```cs
using System.Net;
using BankingSite.Controllers;
using BankingSite.Models;
using Moq;
using NUnit.Framework;
using TestStack.FluentMVCTesting;

namespace BankingSite.ControllerTests
{
    [TestFixture]
    public class LoanApplicationSearchControllerTests
    {
        [Test]
        public void ShouldReturn404StatusWhenLoanIdNotExists()
        {
            var fakerepository = new Mock<IRepository>();

            var sut = new LoanApplicationSearchController(fakerepository.Object);

            sut.WithCallTo(x => x.ApplicationStatus(99)).ShouldGiveHttpStatus(HttpStatusCode.NotFound);
        }

        [Test]
        public void ShouldRenderApplicationWhenIdExists()
        {
            var fakerepository = new Mock<IRepository>();

            fakerepository.Setup(x => x.Find(99))
                          .Returns(new LoanApplication { FirstName = "Larry" });

            var sut = new LoanApplicationSearchController(fakerepository.Object);

            sut.WithCallTo(x => x.ApplicationStatus(99))
                .ShouldRenderDefaultView()
                .WithModel<LoanApplication>(x => x.FirstName == "Larry");
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing View Rendering

#### Creating an Initial Test

So we're going to start by adding a new class here and we're going to call this `HomeIndexView` Tests then install `PM> install-package Microsoft.Asp.Net.Mvc`

```cs
using BankingSite.Models;
using HtmlAgilityPack;
using NUnit.Framework;
using RazorGenerator.Testing;

namespace BankingSite.ViewTests
{
    [TestFixture]
    public class HomeIndexViewTests
    {
        [Test]
        public void ShouldRenderLoanInterestRate()
        {
            var sut = new Views.Home.Index();

            var model = new InterestRates
            {
                LoanRate = 23.45m
            };

            HtmlDocument html = sut.RenderAsHtml(model);

            var renderedLoanRate = html.GetElementbyId("loanRate").InnerText;

            Assert.That(renderedLoanRate, Is.EqualTo("23.45"));
        }
    }
}
```

if you debug class `ShouldRenderLoanInterestRate`, here are the results:
