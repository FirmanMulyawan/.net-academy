# Hands on Lab Week 10 Day 2 <br>Data Operations: Insert, Update and Delete

## Scenario 1: Inserting data into table from another table

- Beth asks Troy to create a new table called ActorNew and ask him to populate it with data from Actor table of __DVDRental database__
- Tasks:
    - Create new Table ActorNew
    - Populate it with data from Actor Table

> __Download__<br>
> For sample database `dvdrental` and then loading the sample database into the PostgreSQL database server.<br>
 http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/load-postgresql-sample-database

#### Step 1 Create table `ActorNew`
The next column is where we identify `actor_id` as `PRIMARY KEY` for table `actornew`. Though Beth has not asked us to do this, we can leave this as it is because it is always a good practice to have `PRIMARY KEY` in any table. Now, if we are leaving this `CONSTRAINT` as it is, we need to change the name of `CONSTRAINT` to `actornew_pkey` from `actor_pkey`.

#### Step 2 Insert data to table `ActorNew` single row at a time
`INSERT INTO` name of the table, and name of the column is a standard syntax for `INSERT` statement. Next we will specify `VALUES`.

#### Step 3 Insert data to table `ActorNew` multiple rows at a time

```SQL
INSERT INTO PUBLIC.actor
            (actor_id,
             first_name,
             last_name,
             last_update)
VALUES   (?, ?, ?, ?),
	       (?, ?, ?, ?),
	       (?, ?, ?, ?);
```

#### Step 4 Insert data to table `ActorNew` multiple rows with a single insert
 Execute query below.

 ```SQL
 INSERT INTO actornew
             (actor_id,
              first_name,
              last_name,
              last_update)
 SELECT actor_id,
        first_name,
        last_name,
        last_update
 FROM   actornew;
 ```

## Scenario 2: Updating Data into Table

- Beth asks Troy to add column to table ActorNew to display the number of movies each actor has done in their career. Additionally, last_update date should contain latest date and time.
- Tasks:
    - Add and Update new column - FilmCount
    - Update column last_update to current datetime

#### Step 1 Updating single row at a time
Let's click on `actornew` table. Over here we have four columns: `actor_id`, `first_name`, `last_name` and `last_update`. We have to add a new column over here. For that, we can right-click over here and add new column or go to Query Tool and write SQL script. This time we will write a SQL script to add a new column, `ALTER TABLE actornew ADD COLUMN "FilmCount"`, and the date type of the column `FilmCount` will be `integer`.

#### Step 2 Updating multiple rows at a time
Execute query below.

```SQL
UPDATE actornew
SET    "filmcount" = (SELECT Count(title) FilmCount
                      FROM   actor a
                             INNER JOIN film_actor fa
                                     ON a.actor_id = fa.actor_id
                             INNER JOIN film f
                                     ON fa.film_id = f.film_id
                      WHERE  a.actor_id = actornew.actor_id
                      GROUP  BY a.actor_id);
```

#### Step 3 Updating multiple rows and columns together
Execute query below.

```SQL
UPDATE actornew
SET    "filmcount" = (SELECT Count(title) FilmCount
                      FROM   actor a
                             INNER JOIN film_actor fa
                                     ON a.actor_id = fa.actor_id
                             INNER JOIN film f
                                     ON fa.film_id = f.film_id
                      WHERE  a.actor_id = actornew.actor_id
                      GROUP  BY a.actor_id,
                                last_update = Now());
```

## Scenario 3: Deleting Data from Table

- Beth asks Troy to remove data where actor_id is greater than 40. Additionally, she suggested to keep ALL the rows where filmcount is greater than 30.
- Tasks:
    - Remove row with actor_id > 40
    - Keep rows with filmcount > 30

#### Step 1 Retrieve data `actor_id` is greater than 40

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM actornew
WHERE "actor_id" > 40
ORDER BY actor_id;
```

#### Step 2 Retrieve data `filmcount` is less than 30

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM actornew
WHERE "FilmCount" <= 30
ORDER BY actor_id;
```

#### Step 3 Retrieve data `actor_id` is greater than 40 and `filmcount` is less than 30

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM actornew
WHERE "actor_id" > 40 AND "FilmCount" <= 30
ORDER BY actor_id;
```

#### Step 3 Delete data

```SQL
DELETE
FROM actornew
WHERE "actor_id" > 40 AND "FilmCount" <= 30;
```
