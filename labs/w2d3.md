# Hands on Lab Week 2 - Day 3

## <a name="lab1"></a>The Circle Class

This first exercise shall lead you through all the basic concepts in OOP.

A class called circle is designed as shown in the following class diagram. It contains:
- Two private instance variables: radius (of the type double) and color (of the type String), with default value of 1.0 and "red", respectively.
- Two overloaded constructors - a default constructor with no argument, and a constructor which takes a double argument for radius.
- Two public methods: getRadius() and getArea(), which return the radius and area of this instance, respectively.
The source codes for Circle.cs is as follows:
```
/*
 * The Circle class models a circle with a radius and color.
 */
public class Circle {  // Save as "Circle.cs"
   // private instance variable, not accessible from outside this class
   private double radius;
   private String color;
   
   // The default constructor with no argument.
   // It sets the radius and color to their default value.
   public Circle() {
      radius = 1.0;
      color = "red";
   }
   
   // 2nd constructor with given radius, but color default
   public Circle(double r) {
      radius = r;
      color = "red";
   }
   
   // A public method for retrieving the radius
   public double getRadius() {
     return radius; 
   }
   
   // A public method for computing the area of circle
   public double getArea() {
      return radius*radius*Math.PI;
   }
}
```

This Circle class is a “building block” and is meant to be used in another program.
Let us write a test program called TestCircle (in another source file called TestCircle.java) which uses the Circle class, as follows:
```
public class TestCircle {  // Save as "TestCircle.java"
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Declare an instance of Circle class called c1.
      // Construct the instance c1 by invoking the "default" constructor
      // which sets its radius and color to their default value.
      Circle c1 = new Circle();
      // Invoke public methods on instance c1, via dot operator.
      System.out.println("The circle has radius of " 
         + c1.getRadius() + " and area of " + c1.getArea());
   
      // Declare an instance of class circle called c2.
      // Construct the instance c2 by invoking the second constructor
      // with the given radius and default color.
      Circle c2 = new Circle(2.0);
      // Invoke public methods on instance c2, via dot operator.
      System.out.println("The circle has radius of " 
         + c2.getRadius() + " and area of " + c2.getArea());
   }
}
```
Now, run the TestCircle and study the results.
