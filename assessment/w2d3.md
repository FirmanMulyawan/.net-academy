# Assessment Week 2 - Day 3

## Object Oriented Programming

1. What is a class?    
   a. A set of code that defines a type that represents an entity    
   b. An instance    
   c. A function    
   d. An interface that represents an entity    

2. What is an object?    
   a. A function    
   b. An interface that represents an entity    
   c. A set of code that defines a type that represents an entity    
   d. An instance of a class    

3. What is a constructor?    
   a. Any method named using the Create keyword    
   b. Any method named using the new keyword    
   c. A special method named with the class name    

4. What does the Protected access modifier on a member do?    
   a. Protects the member from modification    
   b. Allows the class and any class that inherits from it to access the member    
   c. Allows access only from a base class    

5. How is an explicit interface implemented in a class?    
   a. Adding the interface name to the class signature.    
   b. Writing code for each of the interface members.    
   c. All of these.    

6. What is the difference between an abstract and concrete class?    
   a. Abstract classes don't allow construction using the new keyword.    
   b. Abstract classes have no implementation.    
   c. Concrete classes don't allow construction using the new keyword.    

7. Implementing composition using an Id instead of a reference:    
   a. minimizes coupling.    
   b. makes it easier to save the entity.    
   c. can make the entity retrieval more efficient.    
   d. all of these.    

8. Which syntax creates a new object from the Customer class?    
   a. `Customer currentCustomer;`    
   b. `Customer currentCustomer = Customer.Create();`    
   c. `Customer currentCustomer = Customer.New();`    
   d. `Customer currentCustomer = new Customer();`    

9. What is an extension method?    
   a. A method that extends the state of a class.    
   b. A static method that appears as a method on an existing class.    
   c. A method that extends the functionality of another method.    
 
10. What is the principle of Separation of Concerns?    
    a. Defining parts with minimal overlap    
    b. Decomposing an application into parts    
    c. Each part is responsible for a separate concern    
    d. All of these    

11. Which of the following defines an inheritance relationship?    
    a. Business Customer "is a" Customer.    
    b. Order class "has a" instance of the Customer class.    
    c. Customer class "has a" set of Address objects.    
    d. Customer Repository class "uses a" instance of the Customer class.    
    
12. How cohesive should your classes be and why?    
    a. Maximize cohesion to improve dependencies between classes.    
    b. Maximize cohesion so class members relate to the class purpose.    
    c. Minimize cohesion so class members relate to the class purpose.    
    d. Minimize cohesion to reduce dependencies between classes.    

13. What is a static class?    
    a. A class with properties that cannot be changed.    
    b. A class that cannot be changed.    
    c. A class that cannot be instantiated.    

14. What is the difference between a virtual and abstract method?    
    a. An abstract method cannot have any code in it.    
    b. A virtual method has an implementation, but can be overridden.    
    c. An abstract method MUST be overridden in a derived class.    
    d. All of these.    
 
15. A collaboration relationship between Class A and Class B can be implemented by:    
    a. Class A defining a property that references Class B.    
    b. Class A creating and using an instance of Class B.    
    c. Class A inheriting from Class B.    
 
16. How coupled should your classes be and why?    
    a. Minimize coupling to reduce dependencies between classes.    
    b. Minimize coupling so class members relate to the class purpose.    
    c. Maximize coupling so class members relate to the class purpose.    
    d. Maximize coupling to improve dependencies between classes.    
    
17. What is object-oriented programming?    
    a. Programming exclusively to interfaces    
    b. Building one class for all business logic    
    c. Focusing on objects that interact cleanly with one another    
    d. None of these    

18. A composition relationship between Class A and Class B can be implemented by:    
    a. Class A defining a property that references Class B.    
    b. Class A inheriting from Class B.    
    c. Class A creating and using an instance of Class B.    

19. Which of the following defines a collaboration relationship?    
    a. Customer class "has a" set of Address objects.    
    b. Customer Repository class "uses a" instance of the Customer class.    
    c. Order class "has a" instance of the Customer class.    
    d. Business Customer "is a" Customer.    

20. What is a sealed class?    
    a. A class that cannot be extended with inheritance.    
    b. A class that cannot be changed.    
    c. A class that must be inherited from.
